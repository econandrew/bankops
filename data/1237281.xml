The objective of this assignment is to probe and develop in depth understanding of the impacts of the Surjobati campaign in creating knowledge, understanding and appreciation of quality verified off grid lighting products as a viable solution to the lighting needs of off-grid or semi off grid population of Bangladesh. Specific parameters that the impact assessment would be done on are a) Reach of the campaign and b) Effectiveness of the campaign. 

SCOPE OF WORK:
a) Measure effectiveness of different components of the BTL and ATL campaign in; 
i) Creating reach (has to be measure male and female) through direct exposure or word of mouth. 
ii) The degree of exposure of the sample population to the campaign i.e. how many of the events they have seen/attended and whether they paid attention to the campaign and can recall (unaided) or recognize (aided) it. 
ii) Delivering an understandable and credible message that improved knowledge, understanding and appreciation of Lighting Global quality verified off-grid lighting products.
iii) Influencing the state of change of mind and behavioral intention of the audience in regard to adopting Lighting Global quality verified solar lighting products.
iv) Creating social context that leads toward desired outcome of changing their lighting source to a quality verified solar lantern.
v) Creating positive perception of the Surjobati brand


b) Compare each mode of the campaign i.e Miking, Haats, Uthan meetings and MFUs, to understand which modes are more effective in terms of audience recognition and understanding.

c) Identify the environmental constraints that are keeping exposed targeted population from adopting quality verified lighting sources.

d) Detailed methodology outlining rationale for sample size and budget with breakdown of individual components, mentioning how, why and what needs to be used to achieve the objectives.

e) The Agency will be expected to generate reports and submit proof of data collection including filled questionnaires, photos, audio etc. as per the clients needs. 

f) The agency will also provide adequate support during visits by IFC representatives to observe the fieldwork.</ADVERTISEMENT_TEXT><DRAFT_FLAG>0</DRAFT_FLAG><LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE>English</LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE><ADVERTISE_UNTIL>2017-03-15T23:59:59.0</ADVERTISE_UNTIL><SELECTION_NUMBER>1237281</SELECTION_NUMBER><SELECTION_TITLE>Lighting Asia - Bangladesh Consumer Education and Outreach Campaign Evaluation Audit</SELECTION_TITLE><SELECTION_TYPE_ID>2</SELECTION_TYPE_ID><SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID>8</SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID></SELECTION_NOTIFICATION><SELECTION_COUNTRY><_><COUNTRY_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">BD</COUNTRY_ID><COUNTRY_NAME xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">Bangladesh</COUNTRY_NAME></_></SELECTION_COUNTRY><SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">464293</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1237281</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BB</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">0</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BANK BUDGET</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">464294</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1237281</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">TF016623</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">100</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">SA Inclusive Green Growth</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_></SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><NOTIFICATION_ATTACHMENT/><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">59301</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Experience of the consultants specifically related to the assignment.</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">1</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">0</MANDATORY></_><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">59302</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Adequacy of methodology and the proposed work plan in responding to the Terms of Reference.</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">2</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">0</MANDATORY></_><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">59303</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Qualifications and competence of the key staff related to the assignment.</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">3</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">0</MANDATORY></_></NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT></NOTIFICATION>
