I. About IFC 
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, is a global leader, investor and advisor committed to projects in its developing member countries that reduce extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. IFC finances private sector investments, mobilizes capital in the international financial markets, helps clients improve social and environmental sustainability, and provides technical assistance and advice to businesses and governments in the developing world. IFC creates opportunity for people to escape poverty and improve their lives by providing financing to help businesses employ more people and provide essential services, mobilizing capital from others, and providing risk capital and advisory to ensure scalable and sustainable development. Holding a $50 billion portfolio touching almost every major industry, IFC reaches millions of people in more than 100 countries, creating jobs, raising living standards and building a better future to support the World Bank Group's twin goals: ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

II. About IFCs Private Equity Group 
IFC has been a pioneer in emerging market private equity since the late 1980s, helping it grow from a nascent market to a mainstream asset class. Today IFC is one of the largest investors in the industry. Total private equity investment in emerging markets stands at approximately $320 billion more than ever before, yet still just a tiny fraction of the $2.7 trillion global total. Building the industry further is a key part of IFCs mandate of supporting private sector development and promoting the development of strong local fund managers which provide risk capital to private companies, thereby spurring economic growth. IFCs fund strategy focuses on investing in growth equity and venture capital funds across all emerging market regions, and IFC has a targeted program (SME Ventures) to develop such funds in frontier markets and fragile and conflict affected countries.

III. IFCs SME Ventures Program
The SME Ventures Program helps to launch and invest in funds run by emerging fund managers which provide risk capital to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The Program combines investment in funds with advisory services to fund managers as well as technical assistance to SMEs in the funds portfolios. The program is focused on fragile and conflict-affected countries , as well as other frontier markets (mainly International Development Agency (IDA) borrower countries ). The Program has invested in five funds in its Initial Phase and is being expanded. 

SME Ventures is designed to increase the availability of risk capital to SMEs in difficult markets through the development of strong locally-based fund managers. The Programs advisory component combines capacity building services and dissemination of best practices to strengthen managers investment and operational capabilities, and covers all aspects of fund management, including strategy, operational setup, corporate governance, environmental and social management systems, and portfolio management through exit. The technical assistance component is designed to enable fund managers to provide value addition to the SMEs in the fund portfolios.
