Roster of Experts for supporting implementation of the World Bank Procurement Framework 

Context:
In 2013, the Bank launched a worldwide consultation to reform its procurement policy to provide a more fit-for-purpose approach to its procurement operations. This initiative resulted in the adoption by the Bank, in July 2015, of a new Procurement Framework (PF) applicable to all new investment projects. The PF provides for the use of procurement methods and arrangements that will best fit the purpose of the project. To determine the fit for purpose procurement arrangements, the Borrower is expected to develop a Procurement Strategy for Development for the Project (PPSD) for all investment projects financed by the Bank. 
It requires Borrowers to consider, among other things, the market situation, the operational context, previous experience and the risks. The PPSD provides the basis for preparing the Procurement Plan for the project implementation. To establish the PPSD, the Borrower may use a number of tools and analytical methods based on data and information gathered for that purpose, related to the operational context, the Borrowers capability, the supplier market, Bank and Borrower experience of similar projects and potential risks.
In order to support clients in preparing PPSDs, the World Bank intends to identify a global virtual pool of experts to scope and guide the Borrower for preparing the PPSD.
Consulting firms are invited to apply. More details about the Procurement Framework and the PPSD can be accessed at https://wbnpf.procurementinet.org/

Scoping and guidance of the experts will be sought by World Banks internal and external clients in the following areas: 

1)	Identifying the sources of information that will be used to carry out the different steps of the PPSD, and in particular the market analysis, the operational context, the supply positioning, and the procurement risk analysis;
2)	Providing reference to existing market research or guidance in undertaking research of potential suppliers and price references for activities needed for the project development objectives;  
3)	Assisting in identifying procurement risks based on the data collected, PESTLE analysis, market research and past operations; 
4)	Sharing relevant international/regional experiences for finalizing the procurement arrangements suitable for the proposed project
