This will contribute to increased insurance penetration, consumer protection, and stability.
2.The World Bank is seeking an individual or individuals to support the above project, specifically with respect to a component covering improvements to risk based approaches to supervision of the insurance market in Lebanon

The consultant will deliver the following key outputs:
I.Situational and Reporting Study: Analyze and report on the types of data currently collected and how it can be used for financial analysis, particularly but not limited to risk based capital adequacy tests, and recommend any adjustments that may be considered in financial reporting in the longer term. 

II.Quantitative Study: Collect, examine and analyze actual data and prepare a detailed report on the financial analysis and rating approach that it is recommended would be used, including quantitative elements based on a defined level of adequacy, and a risk based intervention supervisory ladder.

III.Implementation Tools: Develop and deliver tools, implementing guidance and training for front line supervisory staff in line with the results of the quantitative report

4.The assignment is expected to start in January 2017 and be completed by March 2018. 

5.The consultant will report to Roya Vakil (Financial Sector Specialist and TTL of this activity). The consultant will also work under the guidance of Craig Thorburn (Lead Financial Sector Specialist, GFM3A) who is the Technical Lead (TL) assigned to the project to address technical, quality control and related issues. The TL provides peer review of all draft and final reports and may provide guidance to consultants on project related issues of a technical nature. The consultants will need to ensure that the TTL and TL clear all relevant communication with the client and any other stakeholders.

6.The World Bank will also make available internet based facilities such as conference calling, webinar meeting facilities (WebEx), and cloud based file storage and sharing (via box.com) to ensure that the ICC, TTL, TL and consultants are able to collaborate between missions.
