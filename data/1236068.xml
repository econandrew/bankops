ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1236068 - Healthcare Quality Assessment Tool

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The IFC Healthcare Quality Assessment Tool is designed to provide tailored assessment to healthcare providers who want to assess and improve their quality, but currently don't have access to either national or international schemes, or need additional support to prepare for formal accreditation. The proposed IFC Healthcare Quality Assessment Tool will be a modular tool with full-blown and scaled-down versions, so that it can be implemented with hospitals/clinics of different levels of sophistication and in different country contexts.
