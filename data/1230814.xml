ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Nigeria  Kaduna and Kano States
REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST (EoI) FOR MTF SURVEY

The World Bank-ESMAP team with the Ministry of Power and the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is launching the first Global Energy Access Household Surveys in access deficit countries so as to set a baseline to track progress towards Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) goal and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 7 on access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy by 2030. 
Access to electricity in Nigeria has increased from 45% to 56% of the population from 2000 to 2012, however this access is concentrated in urban areas (84%) with rural areas lagging behind (34%). Information on the reliability and quality of the electricity service is also limited. Additionally, while 25% of the total population has access to non-solid cooking solutions, there is another gap between the urban (39%) and rural (11%) populations (WHO). It is important to determine how to close this gap and promote universal access because pollution from solid fuel stoves causes eye problems and respiratory diseases in addition to environmental harm. This survey will collect data to identify the remaining energy deficiencies to target so Nigeria can progress towards the SDG energy objectives. 
World Bank-ESMAP with the Ministry of Power and NERC would like to hire the services of a reputed firm which has extensive experience in household surveys. This firm will conduct the baseline survey on energy access in Nigeria using the Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) approach to track progress towards SDG7 and SE4ALL goal. The survey will be representative of the two states of Kaduna and Kano in the country and administered to both urban and rural localities. 

The survey will consider the service areas covered by KEDCO which covers: Kano State, Jijawa State and Katsina State, and Kaduna Electric service area, which covers: Kaduna State, Kebbi State, Sokoto State, Zamfara State. Seven states in total.

The firm will work with the World Bank-ESMAP, the Ministry of Power and NERC to pre-test, finalize and implement the survey. The firm will provide capacity building to the National Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Power and NERC to ensure continuity on tracking of energy indicators. Data collection should be carefully monitored to ensure high quality information. After completing the fieldwork, the firm will deliver the final dataset and summary report to the World Bank-ESMAP.  Additional details on the scope of work will be available in the Terms of Reference (ToR). 
Interested firms should provide a brief summary of their qualifications to perform the services (max 3 pages). The short-listing criteria will be based on:
1.	Experience in household surveys in sub-Saharan Africa, and specific experience in Nigeria
2.	Experience in the energy or other infrastructure sectors (e.g. water and sanitation)
3.	In-depth understanding of the energy access sector and its socio-economic dimensions
4.	Strong technical skills in qualitative/quantitative research and data analysis
5.	Proven skill in using CAPI - tablet based data collection 
6.	Cultural awareness in dealing with local communities, and interacting with government and local authorities
7.	Excellent writing and analytical and presentation skills in English 
Preferences will be given to local firm with high knowledge of the country energy sector and socio-economic context. International firms are encouraged to team up with local partners. The assignment should start in December 2016 and be completed by end of April 2017.
Short-listed firms will be invited to submit a full technical and financial proposal for the final selection round.
