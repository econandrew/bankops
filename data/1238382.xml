ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1238382 - Assessing the effectiveness of public financing in attracting private sector investment in grid connected solar projects - Evaluation Consultant

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Over the recent past the World Bank, the Climate Investment Funds, and other development partners have been supporting renewable energy projects with the explicit aim to crowd-in private sector investment either through assisting to remove institutional barriers or through providing direct financing and risk mitigation instruments. Given the large infrastructure gap and the limited resources available from governments, there is an increased focus on determining the best ways in which scarce public funding could be used to leverage private sector investments. 

The project aims to assess the effectiveness of grants, concessionary loans and risk mitigation instruments in attracting private sector investment in the development of grid connected solar power projects. 

The World Bank wishes to hire an evaluation consultant to review a long list of projects and draw practical insights and lessons that could inform future interventions.

This assignment will be structured in two phases: (1) Analysis of long list of projects to identify best practices and lessons learnt, and (2) Detailed analysis and stakeholder engagement.

The analysis should aim to address the following evaluation questions:
     (i)   What are the main barriers to the mobilization of private capital for scale up of grid connected solar power projects?
     (ii)  How public finance (including climate finance) support to upstream studies (e.g. resource assessment, grid integration studies, feasibility studies), creation of enabling regulatory instruments and capacity building (e.g. strengthening implementation capacity or enhancing operational skills for renewable energy integration) has been effective in attracting private sector investment;
     (iii) How effective have been the different financing instruments and mechanisms (grant, concessionary debt, contingent financing, guarantees, etc.) in attracting private sector and what lessons can be drawn for future project design? 
     (iv)  What are the main risks to private sector investment that are not addressed through the conventional financing instruments and what role can the development finance community play in mitigating them?

During the second phase, the consultant is expected to conduct a detailed analysis of five projects, with a view to develop comprehensive case studies. This will involve field missions to the countries where the projects are located to engage with local stakeholders including but not limited to: commercial banks, development partners, project sponsors, other private sector actors, regulatory agencies and implementation agencies.
