ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1202631 - Platform, Mobile and Game Development - Mobile Design - Competitive Firm Contract

Assignment Countries:
- Colombia

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The World Bank seeks a firm to provide platform, mobile and game design and development support to the existing beta version of Evoke 2.0. The Evoke 2.0 platform will be an open source resource available to partner organizations around the world. Through this Project on Peace in Colombia, the World Bank seeks technology developers to prepare the Evoke platform for this open source phase and provide the framework to scale the project globally. The firm will be responsible for assisting the World Bank team to design and develop a mobile app to complement the on-line version of Evoke.

The firm will be required to review the existing Evoke platform and game play to design a mobile version of Evoke to be designed as an app and played on Android platforms. The mobile version should both replicate those aspects of the Evoke platform that transfer to a mobile device as well as identify those areas that can not be replicated on a smaller screen. Moreover, the firm should identify those areas of design that can be only done with a mobile device that can not be done with a web platform for instance photos and geo-location. After the design phase, the firm will be expected to develop a prototype app to be tested with a number of participants in Colombia as part of the project. Finally, based on the feedback from the prototype the developer will be required to upgrade and adapt new features and learning from the prototype. 

Deliverables for this objective are as follows:

1. Detailed design specifications for a mobile app to complement the Evoke platform.
2. Prototype of mobile app
3. Final mobile app based on user tests.
