This will contribute to increased insurance penetration, consumer protection, and stability.
2.The World Bank is seeking an individual or individuals to support the above project, specifically with respect to the need for an international consultant to deliver elements of the component covering enhancements to the MTPL product line in the insurance market in Lebanon. 
It is expected that the consultant will work on the project deliverables through a combination of team missions to Beirut and remotely with the rest of the project team and the ICC. The consultant will deliver the following:

I.Development of Guidelines for the Sound and Consistent Implementation of Motor Third Party Liability Insurance including:

a.Advice on policy conditions and benefits for MTPL and design of BI and MD claims guidelines including advice on (i) the drafting of a unified policy wording to be used by all insurance companies, and (ii) the design of MD and BI claims guidelines for an objective assessment of the claim severity and insurance benefits.

b.Working with the local consultant, the consultant will support the delivery of a unified policy wording to be used by all insurance companies (wording will describe the benefits in cases of BI and MD, and the corresponding scale as applicable); BI and MD claims guidelines (wording will describe situations in which a claim is excluded from the insurance coverage).

II.Provide advice on Pricing, Reserving, and Performance Monitoring including advice on:

a.the design of a continuous process to evaluate and publish a minimum tariff structure;

b.rules regarding policy fees and their reporting;

c.the design of regular performance monitoring reports to be filed with the ICC on combined market and company-by-company bases; and

d.the design of a prudential reserving process. 

III.Working with the local consultant, the consultant will develop guidelines for the supervisory process to evaluate and to publish a minimum tariff structure (which should cover the cost of Hit and Run, the cost of running a centralized database, the cost of running a clearinghouse, and additional supervisory fees); sharing of best practices regarding rules for policy fees and reporting; guidelines and best practice recommendations for performance monitoring reports to be filed with ICC; and recommendations for the design of a prudential reserving process.

5.The assignment is expected to start in January 2017 and be completed by March 2018. 

6.The consultant will report to Roya Vakil (Financial Sector Specialist and TTL of this activity). The consultant will also work under the guidance of Craig Thorburn (Lead Financial Sector Specialist, GFM3A) who is the Technical Lead (TL) assigned to the project to address technical, quality control and related issues. The TL provides peer review of all draft and final reports and may provide guidance to consultants on project related issues of a technical nature. The consultants will need to ensure that the TTL and TL clear all relevant communication with the client and any other stakeholders.

7.The World Bank will also make available internet based facilities such as conference calling, webinar meeting facilities (WebEx), and cloud based file storage and sharing (via box.com) to ensure that the ICC, TTL, TL and consultants are able to collaborate between missions.

8.EoIs should also include:

A clear statement of any constraints in availability that the individuals may have regarding periods of travel to Beirut during the expected time of the project;

Contact information that includes phone, email, postal address, country of citizenship, country of residency for taxation purposes, and the contractors UPI number if having done contracted work with the World Bank previously.

9.EoIs may be submitted for this ToR alone or for more than one of the related ToRs for this project  together. They may be submitted by an individual or a group of individuals. If submitted by a group, then the role and allocation of expected time and travel of each individual should be made clear in the EoI.

10.EoIs should recognize that the project includes peer review and quality control by the TL separately from the contracts. Individuals may choose to include separate peer review if they wish or need to for their own professional reasons, but no separate contractual arrangements can be made for such reviews.

11.Interested consultants please send resume, expression of interest, and financial proposal (daily rate) to Roya Vakil (rvakil@worldbank.org) and Craig Thorburn (cthorburn@worldbank.org) no later than January 2, 2017.</ADVERTISEMENT_TEXT><DRAFT_FLAG>0</DRAFT_FLAG><LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE>English</LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE><ADVERTISE_UNTIL>2017-01-02T23:59:59.0</ADVERTISE_UNTIL><SELECTION_NUMBER>1233540</SELECTION_NUMBER><SELECTION_TITLE>Lebanon FIRST Strengthening Insurance Sector Regulation and Supervision: Insurance Specialist  MTPL (International Consultant)</SELECTION_TITLE><SELECTION_TYPE_ID>1</SELECTION_TYPE_ID><SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID>8</SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID></SELECTION_NOTIFICATION><SELECTION_COUNTRY><_><COUNTRY_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">LB</COUNTRY_ID><COUNTRY_NAME xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">Lebanon</COUNTRY_NAME></_></SELECTION_COUNTRY><SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">456346</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1233540</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BB</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">0</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BANK BUDGET</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">456347</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1233540</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">TF019313</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">100</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">Lebanon #B017 Strengthening Insurance Sector Regulation and Supervision</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_></SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><NOTIFICATION_ATTACHMENT/><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT/></NOTIFICATION>
