ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1233856 - Design and Implementation of the Albanian Electricity Balancing Market

Assignment Countries:
  - Albania
  - Kosovo

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Albania is in the process of establishing a Power Exchange. This is an important step for the future operation of the power sector in Albania and in line with the international obligations of the country vis-&#224;-vis the Energy Community, and the recent MoU signed as part of the WB6 process. Creating a Day-Ahead Market is the natural starting point for liberalizing the power sector as this will allow for the regional integration with neighboring countries through market coupling. An organized day-ahead market remains however incomplete, without also the co-existence of a Balancing Market.
This project consists of all the technical, regulatory and legal support to develop, establish and operationalize a working Balancing Market for Albania. This is a very concise assignment taking into account the target dates: by 1 October 2017 to have the starting of the Dry-run phase and by 1 January 2018 the go live and initiation of commercial operation of the Balancing Market.
