DESCRIPTION 
A recent state wide estimate by the Technical Group on Urban Housing Shortage (2012-17) states that there is a shortfall of about 4,10,000 housing units in Odisha. The rising land and construction costs have made affordable housing out of reach for the EWS and LIG households in the urban areas. Hence, the Government of Odisha has taken up Housing for All with a vision to provide affordable housing options to all urban residents in Odisha and has launched Policy for Housing for All in Urban Areas, Odisha in 2015. Under the umbrella of this policy, Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) is taking up a number of slum redevelopment and affordable housing projects and plans to launch around 10,000 EWS dwelling units shortly under this scheme. 
However, successful implementation of all these projects requires a robust implementation framework within Govt. of Odisha. For this purpose, BDA is looking to engage consultant services of a firm to assist them in  a) Streamlining beneficiary identification, registration and allotment process in affordable housing; and b) Providing assistance in identification and selection of micro-finance institutions for economically weaker and low income beneficiaries.
