About IFC Cities Initiative

Cities are critical for economic growth and poverty reduction. 80% of global GDP is currently generated by cities with 70% of the emerging market population expected to live in cities by 2050. Cities also generate about 70% of the worlds greenhouse gases. 
Urban density, agglomeration and proximity are fundamental to human advancement, economic productivity, and social equity. Yet in many cities inadequate infrastructure stifles development and drives up costs. 
Strategic city interventions can reduce urban poverty and boost shared prosperity by creating jobs, improving service delivery, employment productivity and overall resilience to economic, financial and environmental shocks. 
IFC is scaling up its financial and advisory services offerings to help cities become more competitivemore attractive places for people to live and firms to operateby: i) strengthening institutions and regulations; ii) improving critical infrastructure and environmental sustainability; iii) fostering skills and innovation; and iv) expanding access to finance. IFC is uniquely positioned to bring together municipalities, utilities and private sector players to comprehensively address the most pressing needs of cities in emerging markets.
IFC has invested $9.5 billion in 292 city related projects in more than 61 counties across 207 cities, and provided advisory services through an additional 228 projects to 127 cities in 62 countries in the 2004-2015 period. While some of the effects of these investments and advisory work clearly relate improved urban services and utilities, better transport infrastructure, the adoption and of climate friendly technology and construction of certified energy efficient infrastructure, IFC has not systematically explored or measure the magnitude of its medium to long term effects.
 
The context of Turkeys cities and Izmir

Turkey is one of the fastest urbanizing countries, with 75% of its population currently residing in urban areas, and with four of the worlds 10 most dynamic cities within its borders. It is envisaged that Turkey will require major infrastructure investments in order to address its main developmental challenges, and will in particular need to upgrade its urban infrastructure to meet the demands created by the increasing and rapid trend of urbanization. Within this frame, gaps in the transportation and energy sectors are among the key challenges to Turkeys development trajectorythe lack of Turkeys energy independence alone, and its subsequent net-energy importer position, have since led to an inflated current account deficit. Developing appropriate transportation modes and energy types is therefore critically important for Turkey, and leveraging sustainable interactions of these two priorities (e.g. electric buses) can prove especially useful. In keeping, building sustainable cities is a key element both of Turkeys national development plan, and of the WBGs Country Partnership Strategy for 2012-15. As part of this strategy the WBG has designed a Joint Implementation Plan (JIP) within which a primary objective is to provide improved sustainable city infrastructure services to at least 3 million people in Turkey. The objective is expected to be achieved by improving the coordination of public and private financing commensurate to Turkish cities creditworthiness, and by improving project planning capacities at the municipal level.   
Turkeys 3rd largest metropolitan area is Izmir, a port city and tourism hub on the Aegean coast, home to over 4 million people. With a diversified local economy, it accounts for about 8% of national GNP, and has one of the strongest credit standings in Turkey, and within IFCs infra portfolio. Izmirs metropolitan limits have recently expandeda new law introduced in 2014 resulted in several new districts being brought within the citys borders. Bringing basic urban services to these recently incorporated areas, including water and waste management, remains the greatest challenge for the city. 



The subject of study: IFCs interventions in Izmir  

IFCs partnership with the Municipality of Izmir spans over a decade, with projects focusing on a range of priority sectors as depicted in Figure-1 below. To support these investments, IFC and MIGA built complementary working partnerships, whereby IFC facilitated the participation of local counterparts and played an anchor-role in arranging large-scale financings that mobilized IFIs and MIGA, and MIGA leveraged its competitive products so as increase security and incentives for the participation of commercial banks.
IFCs engagements in Izmir within the 2010-15 period comprises of nine investments in private companies and state owned utilities, and of two advisory engagements. In sum, they focused on the following:
a)	Transport and urban infrastructure and equipment. This includes the expansion of metro, ferry, and electric buses fleets, the expansion of tramway lines, and the implementation of traffic management systems.
b)	Port infrastructure in the Aegean coast/Nemrut bay
c)	Water and waste management plants and infrastructure. 
d)	Construction of certified green building premises in universities. 
e)	Advise on the adoption of energy efficient practices, and financing options including Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Over time, IFC has both positioned itself as a trusted advisor to the Izmir Municipality, and strengthened this role, by supporting the municipality in selecting, assessing and developing projects.
