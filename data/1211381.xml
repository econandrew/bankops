REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR SELECTION OF FIRM

1. Background:
Womens economic empowerment and participation in Afghanistan is being increasingly acknowledged as an integral part for the development and the sustainability of the country. To this end, the new Government of Afghanistan (GoA) has announced its commitment to women economic empowerment and has commenced the development of WEENAP, an initiative led by the Presidents office. 

Historically in Afghanistan, womens participation in income generating activities is unsystematic and not well accounted for, especially that women are mostly engaged in unpaid or low-paying jobs and in an informal and unregulated economy. Furthermore, the nature and outcomes of womens participation in the labor force are exacerbated by their perceived position in society and their vulnerability for being women. While recently women have been more visible in the economic sphere than ever before, there continues to be structural, cultural, and social constraints including exclusion from existing power structures and restrictions on female visibility and presence in public spaces that continue to pose challenges to the full potential of women economic empowerment. Womens economic participation remains very low, and national programs of women economic empowerment lack in offering modalities and best practices to inform future policy making and programming.

Against this backdrop, and in order to support the development of WEENAP and subsequent programming, the proposed research will aim to (i) conduct a nationally representative mapping of all women economic empowerment programs to assess geographical outreach, inclusion, and participation, and (ii) assess lessons learned to mitigate constraints and challenges and provide innovative and contextual recommendations for the government and donors to develop and implement WEENAP.

2. Scope of services: 
The objective of the task is to review the impact and sustainability of donor-funded gender projects (not just the World Bank or ARTF) over the last decade. More specifically, the analysis will aim to:
	Identify and map programming on women's economic empowerment from 2008 onwards across five regions and different layers of governance (provincial, district and village) as well as national programs.
	Synthesize constraints, opportunities, and lessons learned for women economic empowerment through examining modalities, implementation arrangement, outcomes, and impacts
	Identify context specific indicators to monitor and evaluate women economic empowerment (beyond income generation)
	To provide concrete recommendations for gender programming to the government, donors and implementing agencies

Expected Results:
	A contextual definition and understanding of what constitutes women economic empowerment
	A detailed map of women economic empowerment in Afghanistan since 2008
	Detailed analysis of constraints, opportunities, and lessons learned using a mixed method methodology (survey, focus groups, key informant interviews)
	Concrete recommendations the Women Economic Empowerment National Action Plan (WEENAP) and the National Priority Program on Women Economic Empowerment
	Expert meeting to review the recommendations for the WEENAP

The task should be finalized in 100 days starting with the signatory of the contract to ensure timely inputs to WEENAP.
