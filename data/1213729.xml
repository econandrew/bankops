ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1213729 - Scaling up Power Transmission in Africa

Assignment Countries:
  - (countries have not yet been selected)

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Access to electricity remains a global development challenge with about 1.4 billion people lacking access to electricity. For achieving universal access to modern energy services by 2030, investments will need to grow by more than five-times to $40-50 billion a year - equivalent to around 3 percent of global energy investment. There is a disproportionately large (compared to other regions) funding gap affecting SSAs power sectors which cannot be met by the limited public finances of African countries alone. Private participation is inevitable and efficiency considerations dictate to foster private investments where it is more suitable along the energy value chain. While much of the focus in scaling up investments in the power sector has been on the upstream generation capacity expansion, corresponding levels of investments are also required for SSAs transmission segment, which today accounts for only 1 percent of global private sector investments in power sector, excluding generation. Without these transmission investments, there is a high risk of creating system bottlenecks, stranded generation assets, and the unfulfilled promise of service delivery and access promotion.
The high level objective of the proposed Scaling up Power Transmission in Africa (SUPTA) study is to support mobilization of private capital for greenfield power transmission investments (IPTs) in Africa. While private participation for IPPs, as well as IPTs has become standard investment mechanisms in Latin America (LAC), and much of South/East Asia (SAR); within Africa, PSP in the electricity sector has generally been limited only to IPPs. This study will analyze and expand the knowledge of frameworks and models and underlying ecosystems for scaling-up IPTs in Africa and to provide recommendations on specific pipeline transactions. The investigation will examine the underlying conditions in detail  including (i) relevant sector legislation, policies, and regulation; (ii) public sector technical, planning, and financial capacity; (iii) financial structuring of transactions, availability of funding from multiple sources and access to international capital markets, as well as tariff structure reforms; and (iv) associated environmental and social compliance aspects. In order to provide a focused analytical discussion, the study will not go into detailed diagnostic of retail-end/distribution level issues (system to household, last-mile consumer connections), but focus on wholesale, system-to-system transmission networks only (high voltage lines).
