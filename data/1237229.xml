The Central American economies are energy intensive and electricity demand is expected to grow fast in the mid-term, at about 5 percent per annum for the next 10 years. Besides the expected increase of demand resulting from the economic development in Central American countries, this demand is exacerbated by inefficient consumption patterns and uses. In addition, energy prices in the region are among the highest in LAC and the power sector is exposed to volatile international oil prices, as result of the limited indigenous resources and the high contribution of expensive and polluting thermal technologies to the energy mix. Under these circumstances, energy efficiency presents an opportunity to optimize consumption and, as consequence, to partially reduce or eliminate generation produced by the most expensive and polluting units. Furthermore, the implementation of energy efficiency measures would contribute to achieving international commitments and national targets on climate change, as those derived from the COP21 in Paris.

In this context, the World Banks Global Energy Practice invites firms to submit a proposal to undertake a technical study that will inform about potential high-impact opportunities for improvements in Energy Efficiency and Demand Management in the following six Central America countries: Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The study will be initially performed for three of the six countries (Phase I) and, later on, the work could be potentially extended to the others (Phase II). 

The study will analyze the structure and sources of power demand as well as key drivers in each country in order to recommend both energy efficiency and demand management measures that ultimately optimize the total energy consumption in the country, particularly during peak demand periods. The analysis will entail the development of the following tasks. The World Bank could accept additional proposals from firms in order to meet the objective.

i)	Analyze power demand patterns in the country by season, day of the week, and time of day, including the effect of climate events, such as droughts or floods.
ii)	Map out the consumption patterns (and trend) of key sectors: residential, industrial, public, commercial, and identify largest consumers within those (where relevant) and define main drivers of energy demand.
iii)	Detect key barriers to EE and carry out a stakeholder mapping outlining potential challenges in implementing efficiency measures as well as potential enabling factors.
iv)	Recommend potential measures/technologies to increase EE and shift demand from peak to valley periods. 
v)	Determine an energy consumption baseline from a national and sectoral perspective, taking into account the expected economic growth in each country and business-as-usual energy intensity. 
vi)	Perform the technical and economic analysis of different energy efficiency and/or demand management initiatives in the identified sectors/consumers in ii), estimating implementation costs as well as the potential impact on electricity consumed.
vii)	Define targets for alternative more energy efficient scenarios based on tasks v) and vi).
viii)	Recommend an energy efficiency action plan at national level. 
ix)	Assess the action plans impact on GHG reduced/avoided from the baseline and determined their contribution to national commitments such as NDC, Nationally Determined Contribution.
x)	Outline a proposal for a measuring, reporting and verification system (MRV) of the initiatives recommended in the energy efficiency action plan defined in viii), in order to evaluate their impact.

This scope of work defines the framework of the assignment. However, the specifics for the different countries will be set out in their respective TORs, according with local needs, available information and previous studies.  

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The World Bank now invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in providing the services. Interested firms must provide information indicating that they are qualified to perform the services (brochures, description of similar assignments, experience in similar conditions, availability of appropriate skills among staff, etc.). Please note that the total size of all attachments should be less than 5MB. Firms may associate to enhance their qualifications.

Interested firms are hereby invited to submit expressions of interest. This request is only for Phase I.

Expressions of Interest should be no more than 25 pages and should be submitted, in English, electronically through World Bank Group eTendering (https://wbgeconsult2.worldbank.org/wbgec/index.html)

NOTES

Following this invitation for Expression of Interest, a shortlist of qualified firms will be formally invited to submit
