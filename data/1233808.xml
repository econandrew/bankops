Assignment Countries:  Nepal 

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION 

The World Bank invites Expression of Interest (EoI) from Consulting Firms to conduct Independent Procurement Review (IPR) for five (5) Bank-financed projects in Tajikistan. The objective of the IPR is to review the procurement, contracting, and implementation processes which have been followed for contracts in the projects to confirm consistency with the Financing Agreements (FA). It aims particularly to : (i) Verify that the procurement and contracting processes have been followed; (ii) Perform an independent review and qualitative analysis of the Bank's procurement supervision; (iii) Verify technical compliance, physical completion, and price competitiveness of each contract; (iv) Identify additional risks and mitigation measures to improve risk management and address risks more effectively. To this end, the consultant will: (i) Determine whether the procurement and contracting processes were carried out in accordance with the FA and achieved the expected economy and efficiency; (ii) Determine to the extent possible whether identified non-compliance with the FA, inappropriate practices or questionable decisions/actions, may have been related to corrupt practices; (iii) Evaluate the quality, timeliness and reliability of the Bank's reviews and checks in ensuring that procurement, contracting and disbursement is being carried out in accordance with the FA ; and (iv) In light of any deficiencies, identify ways of improving the procurement and contracting process, identify associated risks, and propose risk mitigation measures.
