Expressions of Interest are limited to 10 pages in total.  Exceeding this limit or providing other attachments will lead to automatic disqualification.  The document should be provided in pdf format only and include all relevant information including a cover letter if desired, a statement of interest and qualifications, and summary biographies of key personnel (do NOT provide full cv's).  In the EOI, firms are instructed to present capabilities and experience in: the Vietnam energy market; gas and power markets and regulation; the liquefied natural gas market; and upstream issues, including the structuring of incentives for investment in mature oil and gas basins.  Please note that EOIs are strictly limited to 10 pages in total, and should be submitted as a single pdf through the econsultant2 system.

This activity is intended to provide guidance to MOIT and other key agencies in Vietnam in the following areas: Economic costing of natural gas; options for evolution of market-based pricing of natural gas, and the options for natural gas market development post-2020; synchronization of emerging liberalized gas market with competitive power market and with the long-term gas contract market; development options for supporting infrastructure; and advice on the natural gas regulatory mechanism, including specific approaches to price formation and regulation.  The above considerations will feed into a draft Government policy which will include implementation roadmaps with specific targets and timelines. The scope of work requires two areas of specialization: first, in the economics of natural gas, LNG, and power, and second, in upstream natural gas. The key dynamic in Vietnam leading to fulfillment of the Government vision of competition in the gas market will be the ability of gas from different sources to enter the market without undue barriers.  That requires a market that has integrated infrastructure available to market participants on a non-discriminatory basis, is not overly encumbered by inflexible long-term contracts, and has market-based pricing that can transmit strong price signals to suppliers and consumers alike.

It will be essential to provide advice to MOIT and other agencies about how different scenarios for Block B, Blue Whale, Son My LNG, and other, smaller developments in Vietnam's offshore affect the development of the onshore gas market and the evolution of gas-fired power within the competitive power market.  Energy sector dynamics have been affected by the rapid and unexpected downward price movements in oil, gas, and coal and the impact of "lower for longer" on upstream developments and LNG ambitions will need to be carefully assessed.

This activity is funded by ESMAP, a multi-donor trust fund, and EAAIG, a trust fund provided by Australia and focused on Asia.</ADVERTISEMENT_TEXT><DRAFT_FLAG>0</DRAFT_FLAG><LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE>English</LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE><ADVERTISE_UNTIL>2016-02-11T23:59:59.0</ADVERTISE_UNTIL><SELECTION_NUMBER>1211198</SELECTION_NUMBER><SELECTION_TITLE>Vietnam:  Roadmap for Natural Gas Market Development</SELECTION_TITLE><SELECTION_TYPE_ID>2</SELECTION_TYPE_ID><SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID>8</SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID></SELECTION_NOTIFICATION><SELECTION_COUNTRY><_><COUNTRY_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">VN</COUNTRY_ID><COUNTRY_NAME xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">Vietnam</COUNTRY_NAME></_></SELECTION_COUNTRY><SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">413016</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1211198</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">TF0A1683</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">50</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">Roadmap For Natural Gas Market Development</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">413017</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1211198</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">TF0A1237</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">50</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">Vietnam: Roadmap for Natural Gas Market Development</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">413015</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1211198</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BB</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">0</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BANK BUDGET</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_></SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><NOTIFICATION_ATTACHMENT/><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">50260</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Provide information showing that they are qualified in the field of the assignment.
