ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW:
Final Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Poverty and Social Impact Analysis

Assignment title: 
1207964 - Final Evaluation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Poverty and Social Impact Analysis

Assignment countries: 
World


ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
To scale up and mainstream PSIA work within the Bank and its client countries, a group of donor countries launched the MDTF in February 2010.  The establishment of the MDTF was supported by governments of European countries including Germany (via the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development and GIZ), the Netherlands (via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Norway (via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Switzerland (via Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation), and the United Kingdom (via Department for International Development).  The overarching goal of the MDTF is to assist the Bank and its client governments in examining the poverty, social and distributional implications of their policy interventions across different sectors.  The MDTF has two specific objectives:  (1) to encourage the effective use of poverty, social and distributional analysis in guiding the Banks policy dialogue and program lending; and, (2) to strengthen client country capacity to implement and use the results of poverty, social and distributional analysis to inform national stakeholders, consider alternative inclusive policies and identify mitigating measures when needed. The PSIA MDTF is nearing the end of its implementation and anticipates concluding operations in October 2016. 

The consulting services (the Services) include the execution of the final review of the MDTF. The main purpose of the evaluation is to assess the impact and effectiveness of the MDTF in achieving its two objectives. The MDTF supported over two hundred individual PSIAs and launched knowledge events to disseminate the PSIA approach and develop capacity.  In addition, as part of this review, it will be important to assess the governance and cost efficiency of the MDTF, in particular, the efficacy and efficiency of its decentralized structure. Finally, the review will gauge the relevance of the PSIA MDTF to the current development landscape and suggest follow-up measures that are appropriate to further and deepen the PSIA agenda after the closing of the MDTF. 

The evaluation is expected to be conducted applying quantitative and qualitative methods, in as rigorous a manner as possible in order to provide reliable conclusions and recommendations based on evidence and analysis.  The evaluation will be mainly based on a participatory approach using structured and unstructured interviews that will involve PSIA task team leaders and/or teams and counterparts (both from within and outside of the Bank) in all case studies.  The evaluation design and methodology should be aligned with the methodology that was used for the Mid-term Review (MTR)[1], suggestions made by the MTR and requirements from the results framework.

The World Bank now invites eligible consulting firms (Consultants) to indicate their interest in providing the Services. Interested Consultants should provide information demonstrating that they have the required qualifications and relevant experience to perform the Services. The shortlisting criteria are: Established background in social sciences and economics, proven track record of conducting similar evaluations, familiarity with poverty and distributional impact analysis, prior project experience with development policy and international aid, competence in quantitative and qualitative methodology, experience and/or familiarity with World Bank trust funds, and knowledge and experience in working with the World Bank.
