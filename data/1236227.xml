February 2017

Request for Expressions of Interest for a consultant firm to collect survey information on socio-economic characteristics, psychological traits, business knowledge, and enterprise information from 2,000 women entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa and Adama localities in Ethiopia. 

In order to deliver effective training to women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia, and to generate evidence on how various approaches to entrepreneurship training impact the growth of women-owned businesses, the WEDP program seeks to pilot and measure innovative approaches to entrepreneurship training. The WEDP program is working with Ethiopias Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Colleges to deliver entrepreneurship training in Ethiopia. The World Banks Africa Gender Innovation Lab (henceforth the WB research team) is conducting an experiment to measure the impact of providing the women entrepreneurs with training. 

Baseline data was successfully collected on this sample population on a rolling basis before they entered the training, between October 2015 and March 2016. The WB research team is seeking to contract a survey firm that will carry out the follow-up data collection for the 2000 women entrepreneurs in the sample. The survey firm may be requested to interview the husbands of the women entrepreneurs too to help measure interactions with the household. 

The firm will be responsible for 
	Activity 1: Action plan for data collection.
	Activity 2: Translation, testing, and formatting of the electronic version of the questionnaire.
	Activity 3: Preparation of interviewer training curriculum and materials, manuals and implementation of personnel training, field test. 
	Activity 4: Recruitment, contracting, and payment of experienced enumerators and supervisors, the number of which should be approved by the research team.
	Activity 5: Implementation of the midline and endline surveys using tablets, including organization and provision of logistical support (transport, per-diem, etc.) to interviewers and supervisors while data are being collected.

This Request for Expressions of Interest is for assistance from a consultant (survey firm) in conducting activities for the midline and endline surveys for this project.

Interested firms should provide information demonstrating that they have the required qualifications and relevant experience to perform the services. The shortlisting criteria are: (i) expertise in field work required for large scale economic surveys; (ii)  experience in implementing firm and household surveys on the scale of this project in Ethiopia; (iii) skills in project management; (iv) capacity in database design, data management, and statistics. The expression of interest may include brochures, description of similar assignments, experience in similar conditions, availability of appropriate skills among staff, etc.

The midline survey will start in March 2017 and an endline survey is planned for 2018.</ADVERTISEMENT_TEXT><DRAFT_FLAG>0</DRAFT_FLAG><LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE>English</LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE><ADVERTISE_UNTIL>2017-02-27T23:59:59.0</ADVERTISE_UNTIL><SELECTION_NUMBER>1236227</SELECTION_NUMBER><SELECTION_TITLE>Ethiopia Entrepreneurship Training Impact Evaluation Follow-up Data Collection</SELECTION_TITLE><SELECTION_TYPE_ID>2</SELECTION_TYPE_ID><SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID>8</SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID></SELECTION_NOTIFICATION><SELECTION_COUNTRY><_><COUNTRY_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">ET</COUNTRY_ID><COUNTRY_NAME xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Country/1.0">Ethiopia</COUNTRY_NAME></_></SELECTION_COUNTRY><SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">462016</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1236227</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BB</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">0</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BANK BUDGET</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">462017</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1236227</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">TF015741</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">100</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">Gender and Entrepreneurship</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_></SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><NOTIFICATION_ATTACHMENT/><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">58745</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Expertise in field work required for large scale economic surveys</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">1</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">1</MANDATORY></_><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">58746</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Experience in implementing firm and household surveys on the scale of this project in Ethiopia</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">2</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">1</MANDATORY></_><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">58747</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Skills in project management</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">3</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">1</MANDATORY></_><_><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">58748</NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT_ID><CONTENT xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">Capacity in database design, data management, and statistics.</CONTENT><ITEM_ORDER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">4</ITEM_ORDER><MANDATORY xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Notification_Qual_Crit/1.0">1</MANDATORY></_></NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT></NOTIFICATION>
