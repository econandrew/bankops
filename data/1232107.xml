The overall task of this consultancy is to estimate how the nature of jobs will change in Vietnam and in two other EAP countries, due to various occupations and tasks susceptibility to automation. In essence, the consultant would

Zierahn (2016)3--to estimate the distribution of automatability of jobs in Vietnam (Figure 2 in AGZ). The consultant would use the Vietnam 2011 STEP worker survey to map the task-content of jobs at the 3-digit occupation level and the Vietnam 2016 Labor Force Survey data on the distribution of occupations across the economy and the demographic profiles behind those jobs.
(2) Compare the estimates using the task-based approach to those using the occupation based approach
(3) Identify which segments of the population  gender, age, skill-level, geographic location  are more likely to be affected by automation
(4) Identify the tasks that will disappear and those that will not, based on available data
(5) Estimate step (2) for two other countries, using the task-composition of jobs from the Vietnam STEP survey and labor force surveys from the other two countries
(6) Compile the results in a PPT and a short paper, complete with a brief literature review, detailed assumptions, methodology, data discussion, presentation of results, and interpretation of the statistical findings.
