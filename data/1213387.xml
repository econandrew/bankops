HONIARA FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT STUDY AND PLAN

Honiara is the capital city of the Solomon Islands and serves as its main transport hub and economic, political and educational centre. It is located on the north coast of Guadalcanal with an area of 22 km2 and a rapidly growing population of 69,067.
A slow-moving low pressure system caused very heavy rain and severe flooding in and around Honiara on 3 April 2014. Flooding of the Mataniko River destroyed 239 houses and claimed 21 lives. The Lungga River flooded Honiara International Airport. The total economic value of the floodings impact is estimated at SI$787.3 million (US$107.8 million), equivalent to 9.2% of GDP.

Following a mission to assess opportunities for improving resilience to flooding, and another to identify and survey flood peak levels, the World Bank is now seeking expressions of interest to prepare a Flood Risk Management Study &amp; Plan for Honiara and its environs, the key purpose of which is to develop a strategic plan to guide investments to better manage flood risks in the greater Honiara area. This will be facilitated through the development of fit-for-purpose flood modelling for greater Honiaras main river systems.

The scope of work includes: 

	Capturing LiDAR data and developing a Digital Elevation Model;
	Preparing hydrologic and 1D/2D hydraulic flood models, calibrated to the April 2014 flood, and using these for design flood modelling and hazard mapping;
	Assessing flood risks including to buildings, roads, critical infrastructure and life;
	Evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of various flood risk management options, including flood protection measures, planning measures and flash flood warning systems;
	Engagement and capacity building with Solomon Island Government (SIG) and Honiara City Council (HCC) stakeholders and community representatives;
	A multi-criteria assessment of the flood risk management options, informing a Plan of recommended measures.

Eligible consultants are invited to indicate their interest in providing the services. Interested consultants must provide:

	A list of recent, relevant work in regards to the services above, which has been conducted by the consultants;
	Evidence of capacity for: (1) ensuring provision of an accurate DEM; (2) robust flood modelling in data-poor contexts; (3) innovative approaches to influencing the informal housing sector, which was especially impacted in the April 2014 flood; (4) stakeholder engagement and capacity building.
	Any evidence of experience in Pacific Island Countries or similar environments (desirable).
