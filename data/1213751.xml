ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

In response to a request from some Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) in 2011, IFC launched the Trade Logistics in the Caribbean project to offer technical assistance to identify issues and constraints facing businesses in the import/export processes and to provide solutions for their improvement. 
A key area of emphasis under this project has been support to the streamlining, integration, harmonization and automation of business processes within border clearance agencies. An electronic solution has been developed to integrate the Bureau of Standards with the Customs Electronic System (ASYCUDA), a software that can be replicated in other Bureaus and also in other border clearance agencies. The project has been implemented in Dominica Bureau of Standards and replicated (adapted for use in the St Lucia and Grenada Bureaus of Standards and other technical control agencies in Dominica).

The assignment is aimed at developing modifications to the existing software (database and source code) to meet additional system requirements identified in User Acceptance testing (UAT) and documenting the core system and modifications once testing has been completed. The consulting firm will be responsible for training of officials at the Bureaus of Standards, Customs and other technical control agencies. The firm is also required to provide support in the form of constant escalation of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) and emergency procedures. It will also involve maintaining code updates, security updates, revisions, as well as minimum/maximum adaptations further required for each country, and undertaking programming and designing tasks as the need arises.
