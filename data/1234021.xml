ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1234021 - Advisory Services: Analytical report on Forest Smart Mining: Identifying good and bad practices for Large Scale Mining in Forest Landscapes

Assignment Countries: Global 


ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The World Bank is seeking the services of a firm to conduct an analysis of how to promote forest smart Large Scale Mining (LSM) in forest landscapes.
the Objective of this study is to identify and analyze, by means of a series of Case studies on Large Scale Mining in Forest Landscapes; good and bad practices that feed into the overall study's objective and serve to identify conditions and mechanism for forest-smart LSM. 
Outcomes:  Identification of good and bad practices and/or enabling conditions related to promoting Forest-Smart LSM based on a series of case studies.
These are intended to inform policy recommendations for the World Bank and World Bank Clients on how to better facilitate/ promote 'Forest-smart mining.

This work will be undertaken in two phases: 

A first phase will include a literature review, general assessment, refinement of criteria and presentation of a short list of potential case studies and a detailed plan of action and methodology for phase two including an outline of the final report. This work will be presented in a discussion forum, to be identified, with the World Bank.

A second phase will include in-depth analysis of case studies which presented to the World Bank and/or other parties for feedback which will be incorporated into a final report. This could include travel to a limited number of case study sites.


BACKGROUND

In its five-year Forest Action Plan, the World Bank prioritizes investments in sustainable forest management and forest-smart interventions that take a landscape approach and consider other sectors. The present program on Extractive Industries in Forest Landscapes fits into this vision that economic sectors do not erode forest capital and generate instead positive forest outcomes. The objective of the program is to enable client countries and the World Bank Group to make better-informed decisions about minimizing trade-offs and maximizing benefits from forest-smart mining. More specifically the program will generate knowledge on the Extractives-Forest Nexus, and how to translate this into forest-smart mining strategies and accompanying tools. 
Forest-smart implies avoiding or minimizing potential adverse impacts on forests. Avoiding any impact can be targeted in landscape level planning of extractives development. Minimizing impact of mining may be pursued through mitigation or compensation measures or LSM and ASM activities. Supporting forest-smart interventions will not only ensure that adverse impacts on forests and their biodiversity are avoided or minimized, but also identify opportunities for increasing the productivity and resilience of other sectors. Minimizing threats involve: avoiding deforestation and degradation; reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to land use change; mitigating impact of droughts, floods and storms; regulating water and climate, and; protecting infrastructure. Forest-smart interventions are based on the aforementioned integrated landscape approach. The consultancy should take into account this concept of Forest-smart mining and answers to what it exactly means for LSM.


ELIGIBILITY

The firm shall have extensive experience in issues around Mining and Sustainable Development, environmental management and mining (including mine closure and rehabilitation), sustainable forest management, REDD+ and Mineral Sector Policy Development and /or sustainable land use planning in developing countries.  The team should have a strong mix of the following skills : 
	Strong knowledge of, and experience in, the development of policies and strategies around LSM and sustainable development. 
	Post-graduate level qualifications in a relevant field, such as conservation biology, natural resource management, Mineral Economics, forestry etc.
	At least ten years of relevant experience working on impact mitigation and sustainable development of Large Scale Mining in developing countries 
	Good knowledge of the policy environment governing the mining sector with strong experience in working with governments, private companies and civil society.
	Strong understanding of, and experience with, sustainable forest management, including REDD+ and sustainable land use planning 
	Strong experience on mining and community engagement  
	Excellent written English, good communication and leadership skills.
	Experience in methodology design and a history of related publications. 
	Working knowledge of the languages of the countries on which case studies are to be conducted would be an asset.
	An existing network of practitioners and local experts in potential case study countries would be an asset.
