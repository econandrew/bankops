ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1231715 - East Africa Regional Interoperability  Infrastructure Landscaping and Analysis

Assignment Countries:
  - East Africa

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Cross-Border Payments in East Africa							

Cross-border payments in East Africa comprise a significant and growing part of regional GDP.  Agriculture related cross-border transactions alone surpass 60 million transactions and USD 900 million in the region annually. USAID estimates that 95% these transactions are made through the physical exchange of cash.  The total size of the informal payments sector in the region remains unknown. However, the types of solutions available for cross-border transactions are becoming more varied. Person to Person (P2P) remittances through digital financial services already account for USD 1.3 billion per year within East Africa.     

GSMA reports a 52% increase in the global volume of cross-border payments over mobile money in 2015.  This makes cross-border services the fastest growing mobile money product. The number of mobile-enabled pathways available for completing these transactions is also increasing. As of December 2015, 29 cross-border remittance corridors connect 19 countries. Over one-third of these corridors exist with or between countries in East Africa.
 
CGAP seeks to better understand the cross-border payments ecosystem within East Africa  how payments are made today and how consumers would like to see them made in the future. It does this with the goal of further easing payments across borders and ultimately increasing financial inclusion within these markets.
 Scope of Work											

As part of understanding cross-border payments in East Africa, CGAP seeks to commission a study of payments infrastructure in the region. The studys objective will be to: 1) identify infrastructure providers operating at the center of East Africa markets (specifically, those providing connectivity or processing services to e-money issuers, banks and other end-user service providers, for example: switches, clearing houses and aggregators), 2) describe the domestic and cross-border transactions relevant to these channels, and 3) understand how participants currently function in the ecosystem (e.g. value chain analysis). Organizations covered by the study will include, at minimum: switches, clearing houses and significant aggregators.
The study will provide an overview of the payments landscape in East Africa, communicating a clear and concise understanding of interoperability throughout the region (depicted visually, and through narrative). The study will also identify trends, business models, and the state of infrastructure active and/or under development.
Research should help answer the following questions: 
1.	Who are the current infrastructure providers operating in domestic and cross-border payments?
2.	What regulatory and licensing requirements exist for infrastructure operators in East Africa?
3.	What are the key roles in the market? (e.g. clearing, settlement, foreign exchange, aggregation) 
4.	How do infrastructure providers enable current payment value chains within their country and across East Africa?
5.	What key payment (and payment supporting) linkages exist to other African and global payment ecosystems?
The Firm will be responsible for the design and conduct of market research across East Africa through a combination of in-depth interviews and analysis, as well as review of existing data and research. Fieldwork and deliverables should include findings from: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda; or a subset of these countries as defined within the final service agreement. 
Research should include direct engagement with payment systems regulators in applicable markets. It should also include engagement with key infrastructure providers, investigating the primary functions performed and how they fit into the overall payments value chain. The most critical providers to identify include those responsible for processing, clearing (switching), settlement, and foreign exchange. A detailed understanding of each market participants role should be obtained, including:
	the clients they serve (banks, mobile money providers, government, MNOs, switches, etc.),
	the organizations business model,
	product pricing and details of services they offer,
	the technology used by the organization,
	the key benefits/limitations of each service as it relates to financial inclusion, 
	how each is currently regulated (if at all), 
	how these stakeholders relate to each other, and  
	ownership structures.
The selected firm will be responsible for: 
1.	Conducting research: The field team deployed for this study must have experience drawing out nuances or subtleties of complex, multi-party systems across multiple markets, and an ability to articulate these nuances in a clear and concise manner. The technical proposal should include a description of one or more approaches that will be used to draw out insights. Examples from previous work (where possible) would be useful. 
2.	Recording and analyzing data: This research must be as analytical as it is informative, demonstrating a clear understanding of the transaction types and volumes that have driven the development of existing market solutions, and that continue to drive their use (or non-use). The technical proposal must therefore demonstrate strong analytical skills. 
3.	Reporting: Final deliverables will be drafted by the selected firm and should include a description of the chosen research methodologies, key findings and general trends, as well as recommendations for improving cross-border payments infrastructure based on the findings. Deliverables must be clear, concise, and compelling -- designed for consumption by a variety of stakeholders. Select deliverables will be distributed for public consumption.
