ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1234921 - Quantitative Research on Social Inclusion and Regional Disparity in the Russian Federation

Assignment Countries:
  - Russian Federation

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The research study objective is to deepen the understanding of how social inclusion,  exclusion,  and vulnerability vary across regions in the Russian Federation(RF). This study aims to ask why certain social groups in the RF regions are included in or excluded from society by analyzing regional patterns and dynamics of their access to economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights. This exercise goes beyond observations that certain groups are overrepresented among the poor or that some have worse human development outcomes, but rather probes deeper to asking why this is the case, and which drivers and processes may contribute to social exclusion, discrimination, and inequality. 

The overall objective of the consultancy is to undertake quantitative research on social inclusion issues in the RF including access to economic and social rights at least in four distinct regions that will be agreed with the World Bank. The research will target 1,200 respondents stratified by vulnerable groups. The envisaged research will generate data on key social inclusion and exclusion indicators in four regions of the Russian Federation to strengthen regional data on social inclusion and regional disparity. 

The Consultant will undertake tablet based data collection that will gather quantitative data on social inclusion of youth, middle aged men, women, and senior citizens in four regions of the RF. The survey must be undertaken in the following four regions: (i) Khabarovskiy Krai; (ii) Sverdlovskaya; (iii) Jewish Autonomous Oblast; and (iv) Irkutsk Oblast.
