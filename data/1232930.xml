ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1232930 - Land Use Planning for Enhanced Resilience of Landscapes (LAUREL): Madagascar and Mozambique

Assignment Countries:
  - Madagascar
  - Mozambique

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The overall objective of this consulting assignment is to support integrated decision making for landscape management in Madagascar and Mozambique, through improved spatial data on land degradation, and through the development of prototype platforms for simulating, and evaluating, land use and land use change processes.

The modeling platform will consist in a spatially explicit decision support tools that Governments can use to assess how socio-economic drivers (e.g. population growth, economic development, etc) and climate change will affect land use change and land degradation in the next 1-2 decades. Against that baseline, the platform will assess the cost-effectiveness of selected interventions (e.g. agriculture intensification, land restoration including reforestation, road network development) that can be considered to reconcile socio-economic development with forest and landscape conservation, in a climate-resilient manner.

FUNDING SOURCE

The World Bank Group intends to finance the assignment / services described below with its own administrative budget and trust funds


INDIVIDUAL / FIRM PROFILE
The consultant will be a firm. The assignment requires the mobilization of a diverse range of highly specialized skills, including land use change modeling, economics, agronomy, soil science, forestry, climate change impact assessment, hydrology, soil erosion and other forms of land degradation, sediment transport analysis, etc. 
The establishment of consortia among organizations with adequate expertise in these domains is therefore encouraged. The participation of organization and/or individual experts from Madagascar and Mozambique is also strongly encouraged. An important criteria for evaluating the EOIs is the demonstrated ability to turn solid analysis into practical decision support tools that Government can apply to concrete policy making and investment selection processes.
