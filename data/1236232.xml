ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1236232 - Scoping Study of Opportunities for Clean Distributed Generation Solutions in Mexico

Assignment Countries:
  - Mexico

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

A. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is seeking consultancy services to undertake an analysis of the current market and key barriers present for clean energy solutions for distributed generation market in Mexico.

This study will primarily focus on the potential for based PV and efficient cogeneration solutions with to serve clients need for clean distributed power generation on a scale at which clean distributed power generation at the facility becomes commercially viable. This study will also map the PV &amp; efficient cogeneration solution providers and leading EPC (Engineering procurement and construction) companies for distributed power generation that are active in Mexico. 

According to Mexican regulatory framework, exist two legal alternatives for on-site power generation.

	Distributed generation: Electric Industry Law establish distributed generation as any power solution connected into the national electric system if this is the case, energy supplier needs a permit in order to sell energy into the grid. In here, electricity is sold to a third user or final user as long as the electricity be generated inside the final user facilities.
According a study published by PwC Distributed Generation will have open and not unduly-discriminatory access to the Distribution grid as well as to markets where its production can be sold.

	Self-consumption: Public Service Electric Energy Law  establish auto-supply as including any power solutions dedicated to inside the fence applications. Mexican regulation does not allow providing energy into the national electric system. Since the energy generated is for self-consumption, sale of energy is possible only for the power plant stakeholders. 
 
Background

The new regulatory framework in Mexico aims to increase energy efficiency and increase not only the installed capacity but also increase clean energy generation. Work in energy efficiency is been done by incentivizing distributed generation, it is estimated that losses in transmission in the national grid were around 15%.  During 2014 the transmission lines worked with 250,000 GWh this means that the losses by transmission inefficiency are approximately 37,500 GWh.

Another appointment in the new regulatory framework is to increase the clean energy generation. In 2013, 83% of electricity generation came from fossil fuels this is equivalent to 243,604 GWh, the dependence in one fuel compromise national energy security. Mexican government has established a goal for year 2024 to generate 35% of the electricity with clean energy source; in consequence, energy security will be enhance by diversifying the national energy mix.


Objectives of the assignment

	To estimate the clean energy distributed power plants in Mexico and explain how is their participation in the electricity market.
	To explain how the clean energy market operates in Mexico (esp. Clean Energy Certificates).
	To assess the regulatory framework for distributed power generation in Mexico.
	To assess the regulatory environment for solar PV and efficient cogeneration solutions for distributed power generation in Mexico
	To estimate the solar PV and efficient cogeneration distributed power generation potential in Mexico
	To estimate the total financing requirement for a certain percentage of solar PV uptake.
	To estimate the total financing requirement for a certain percentage of efficient cogeneration uptake.
	To identify leading PV &amp; cogeneration solutions providers and their business model.
	To identify the leading EPCs for solar PV and efficient cogeneration solutions for distributed power generation that are active in Mexico.

B. SCOPE OF WORK

Building on market research, site visits (max. 3) and in-depth interviews (30), this task will provide succinct assessment of the Mexican distributed generation market. The services of the consultant are structured into the following tasks.

Task 1  Review of regulatory framework and enabling environment. This shall include a rapid review of regulations, incentives, and potential current regulatory/legal/permit barriers, which are applicable and relevant for entities considering distributed generation and clean energy generation.  The consultant shall also produce a short analysis of additional current regulatory/enabling environment related issues that arise when distributed renewable plants are sized in excess of captive load and are looking to sell excess power, and a summary analysis of proposals under consideration of relevance to this option.

Task 2  A synthesis of distributed energy and clean energy in Mexico describing the status quo of this market (ie with estimates of supplier energy supply options) per but not limited to the following categories, the key market segments based on geographic location, production capacity, energy usage profile (for example: stratification of energy source, load profile, and investment potential). 

Task 3  Overview of technical PV solutions and solution providers in the Mexican market identify the leading PV solution providers and their business models; describing the products and services offered in the Mexican market with their main technical characteristics (reliability, achievable power and energy penetration, degree of retrofitting, after sales service provisions, etc.) The Consultant shall also identify and describe the Solar EPCs that are active in the Mexican market.

Task 4  Overview of technical efficient cogeneration solutions and solution providers in the Mexican market identify the leading cogeneration solution providers and their business models; describing the products and services offered in the Mexican market with their main technical characteristics. The Consultant shall also identify and describe the cogeneration EPCs that are active in the Mexican market.

The result of the above tasks shall include
&#173;	a summary report of word format, including a succinct executive summary
&#173;	a PowerPoint presentation of the main results for presentation to external audiences (20-40 slides)

C. DELIVERABLES/SPECIFIC OUTPUTS EXPECTED FROM CONSULTANT

Tentative timeline

	Inception report  week 2
	Annotated outline, data base concept  week 2
	Draft mapping report, and database  week 12
	Complete draft (incorporating feedback on initial draft)  week 16
	Final draft report, final draft database, draft presentation  week 18
	Final report, database, and presentation  week 20

The total man days required for the assignment wont be lower than 100.

Final deliverables

	A summary report of word format, including a succinct executive summary; meaningful segmentation/ categorization of the solar PV market &amp; efficient cogeneration; a ranking of clients based on techno-commercial assessment; solution provider database (e.g. Excel) for all identified providers in Mexico with the main profile information and contact data., and summary section on enabling environment.
	A PowerPoint presentation of the main results for presentation to external audiences (20-40 slides).

All documents shall be submitted in professional English language and in editable World, Excel, or PowerPoint format.

D. SPECIFIC INPUTS TO BE PRESENTED BY THE CLIENT
IFC will share selected input in the form of existing market reports, scoping studies supported by IFC, or useful publicly available resources, and a list of contact info of leading supplier to interview. However, the Consultant is expected to perform independent in-depth research.
