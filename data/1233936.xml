ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1233936 - Delivery of Strategic Framework and Roadmap for Jakarta Smart &amp; Sustainability City Project

Assignment Countries:
  - Indonesia

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Through the IFCs Indonesia Green Building program that started in 2011, a green building code was successfully adopted to help cities manage their energy and water resources to better address the rapid urbanization and infrastructure challenges in Indonesia. However, many cities in Indonesia are yet to enjoy their full potential of resource efficiency due to inadequate urban management and policies. This is due to insufficient data collection and citizen engagement where local government policies are not yet appropriately addressing high priority urban issues and low carbon growth opportunities.

The on-going works at the city level through the Indonesia Green Building Program will help promote green urban infrastructure beyond the green building space and improve urban services using a combination of disruptive technology innovations, policy level advisory services and targeted financial investments. Project engagement will be with city leaders and policy makers as well as businesses, investors and communities to identify infrastructure needs and develop low-carbon solutions. To facilitate this, the program envisions the development of a strategic framework and roadmap for Jakarta City to reduce its carbon footprint by 30% by 2030, as a first step towards building a framework applicable to other large Indonesian cities. 

The strategic framework and roadmap will, in phase one, provide a city government the basic information it needs to decide on an action plan.  It will take into account the following elements:
A.	Identification and prioritization of urban needs and solutions while taking into account experiences and lessons learned from other cities in the following areas; 
1.	Greener buildings (for both new and existing stock)
2.	Low carbon mobility (including, model shift, fuel switching and trip reduction)
3.	Improved waste and water management (including waste to energy opportunities)
4.	Distributed and renewable local energy generation (including, roof-top PVs, district cooling)
5.	Effective governance (including with comprehensive smart city platform which can enable better data collection, solution development and efficient delivery using low-cost and scalable information and communication technology (ICT)
6.	Clean innovation and promotion of clean tech supply chain (including circular economy)

B.	Promotion of facilitation of scalable public and private sector innovative solutions through training, connecting entrepreneurs with peers, investors and experts, and business matchmaking;

C.	 Identification of relevant stakeholders.
In a second phase, the roadmap would be turned into an action plan through close support of municipal authorities.
