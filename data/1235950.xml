of Interest from individual consultants for the Biodiversity Focal Area Study with a specific focus to review the 'mainstreaming' of GEF's Biodiversity activities.

Recently, the GEF IEO undertook a Value for Money (VFM) 
analysis to assess the efficiency of GEF investments and technical support to 
biodiversity projects. Drawing on previous studies and evaluations, 
this current evaluation aims to assess three evolving dimensions of the GEFs
Biodiversity Strategy, that are yet to be independently evaluated. 
These three areas are: 
 Biodiversity mainstreaming, including Payment for Ecosystem Services(PES) 
 Nagoya Protocol and, 
 Combatting Illegal Wildlife Trade 

The studies on Nagoya Protocol and, Combatting Illegal Wildlife 
Trade and PES will be commissioned through separate consultancies.

The primary objective of this consultancy is to undertake an in-depth study to evaluate the conditions under which biodiversity mainstreaming is being operationalized in GEF investments. Specifically, the study will assess: 
The conditions under which biodiversity mainstreaming is being operationalized 
O At the strategic policy level 
O Project design and implementation 
The effectiveness of the Monitoring &amp; Evaluation systems for biodiversity 
mainstreaming 
o What is the results framework? 
O Are the indicators appropriate for assessing the outcomes of mainstreaming 
efforts? 
 Analysis of the Biodiversity Mainstreaming Portfolio 
 Key lessons from the past and ongoing mainstreaming efforts</ADVERTISEMENT_TEXT><DRAFT_FLAG>0</DRAFT_FLAG><LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE>English</LANGUAGE_OF_NOTICE><ADVERTISE_UNTIL>2017-02-19T23:59:59.0</ADVERTISE_UNTIL><SELECTION_NUMBER>1235950</SELECTION_NUMBER><SELECTION_TITLE>Biodiversity Focal Area - Evaluation of Biodiversity Mainstreaming</SELECTION_TITLE><SELECTION_TYPE_ID>1</SELECTION_TYPE_ID><SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID>8</SELECTION_SUB_STATUS_ID></SELECTION_NOTIFICATION><SELECTION_COUNTRY/><SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><_><ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">461434</ID><SELECTION_ID xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">1235950</SELECTION_ID><TRUST_FUND_NUMBER xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BB</TRUST_FUND_NUMBER><PERCENT_APPLIES xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">100</PERCENT_APPLIES><TRUST_FUND_DESC xmlns="http://cordys.com/WBGEC/DBT_Selection_Trust_Fund/1.0">BANK BUDGET</TRUST_FUND_DESC></_></SELECTION_TRUST_FUND><NOTIFICATION_ATTACHMENT/><NOTIFICATION_QUAL_CRIT/></NOTIFICATION>
