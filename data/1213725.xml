ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Background
As part of its work agenda in West Africa, the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice (T&amp;C) of the World Bank Group (WBG) is implementing an Investment Policy (IP) Project financed by the European Union (EU). Implementation of this technical assistance project was launched in May 2014 and is expected to be implemented until December 2018. 

The Project will engage the private sector, the ECOWAS Commission, and the ECOWAS Member States by using a practical framework and mechanism that will identify, address, and monitor the elimination of barriers impeding cross-border investments. On the national level, the Project will implement reforms on the applicable IP issues, such as market access, procedural investment admission, investment incentives, performance requirements, and sectoral policies, to encourage and ease the flow of intra- and extra-regional foreign direct investment (FDI) into the ECOWAS common market. 

International surveys have consistently identified investment-climate (IC) constraints (e.g., access to finance), including IP  obstacles (i.e., investment-entry barriers), as the primary impediments in West Africa that adversely affect foreign, regional, and local investors, particularly small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and service providers. These restraints  which not only inhibit foreign direct investment (FDI) and job-creation potential, but also exacerbate poverty levels in the region  are attributable to several market and regulatory failures that require a proactive reform approach. It has been documented that implementation of reforms to address these regulatory failures can have a positive impact on cross-border investment flows. 

To this end, T&amp;C, in collaboration with the ECOWAS/WAEMU Commissions, the ECOWAS Member States, and private-sector business associations, has designed a Scorecard Tool to promote cross-border IP/IC reforms in the region. The Scorecard Tool is based on the Scorecard Methodology that was approved by the ECOWAS/WAEMU Commissions, the ECOWAS Member States, the EU and the WBG. A major purpose of the Scorecard is to initiate and monitor the national IP/IC reform process by first evaluating the relevant national investment framework and then highlighting those Member State reforms that are required to achieve a greater openness for regional investment.

In order to generate reform momentum, establish a rationale for reform and demonstrate a pattern of successful implementation, the Project will prepare a series of reform case studies that identify and summarize the rationale for undertaking specific IP reforms. These case studies will be used to complement the Regional Scorecard Tool and will form a critical part of the regional peer-to-peer learning process to foster coherent best practice solutions across the ECOWAS region.
reform and demonstrate a pattern of successful implementation, the Project will prepare a series of reform case studies that identify and and summarize the rationale for undertaking specific IP reforms. These case studies will be used to complement a Regional Reform Scorecard Tool and peer to peer learning. The objective of this assignement will be to complete these case studies.
