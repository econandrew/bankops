ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1209420 - India Digital Finance Study

Assignment Countries:
  - India

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

CGAP proposes to conduct a comprehensive study of consumer needs in select geographies as part of support to payments banks in India. The goal of the study is to: (1) develop a deep understanding of the daily financial transactions, savings and payments needs of low-income households, merchants and micro-SMEs (2) identify financial use patterns which could be useful to developing services for such target audiences; (3) investigate specific behaviors related to nano-credit, micro-savings, digital payments at merchants, e-commerce. Geographies may include urban and rural areas of Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana (or AP), and Uttar Pradesh. 

In August 2015, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave 11 entities 18 months to set-up payments banks, a new banking license that allows providers to offer only payments and deposit services while serving as a channel for credit and more.Payments bank presents an unprecedented global learning opportunity in financial inclusion. As a regulatory approach, the payments banks license is game-changing. Arguably, the payments banks regulations go further than most similar international regulations applicable to non-banks making it possible for a range of existing non-bank actors to be licensed as banks, directly regulated by the central bank with ability to offer a bank account, deposit services, with access to and full participation in the national payment system, access to interbank markets for temporary liquidity management, and without restrictions on being an agent for other banks for credit and other services.
