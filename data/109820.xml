ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1209610 - Environmental &amp; Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the Semeikhon Riverside Port Project in Myanmar

Assignment Countries:
  - Myanmar

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This greenfield project will be developed by MMID. IFC, through its proposed equity participation in this InfraVentures project, will play the role of co-developer. SMP is located along the bank of Ayeyarwady River, around 70 km from Mandalay city in Myanmar. MMID is also the developer of Myotha Industrial Park (MIP), a greenfield 10,000 acre mixed-used Industrial Zone.The land footprint of SMP (all phases) is about 152 hectares with an expected quay length of 1,500 meters. SMP will be developed in phases as container port traffic builds up over time. Phase 1 will be designed with one floating berth, barges and cranes with capacity to handle an estimated 200,000 tons of general cargo, containers and roll-on-roll off (ro-ro) cargos.
The purpose of the ESIA is to: (i) determine the environmental and social (E&amp;S) baseline conditions at the projects primary and secondary Areas of Influence (AOI); (ii) analyze all feasible project alternatives; (iii) assess the E&amp;S risks and impacts (direct; indirect; and impacts on vulnerable project affected persons/groups) resulting from the construction and operation of the Project, within the projects primary and secondary Areas of Influence (AOI); (iii) identify appropriate/effective/practicable mitigation measures, and develop E&amp;S management and monitoring programs, based on a clearly articulated avoid/minimize/mitigate/compensate-and/or-offset mitigation hierarchy; and (iv) throughout the entire ESIA process, effectively and representatively identify and consult project affected persons (PAP), members of the general public, and other key stakeholders, in relation to potential project benefits and negative E&amp;S impacts, and demonstrate that stakeholder views have been incorporated into the project E&amp;S design.

The ESIA Consultant shall undertake the following work: 
i.	Undertake E&amp;S scoping, and early review of available primary and secondary data, to focus on key issues/impacts and exclude other issues considered to bring limited impacts;
ii.	clearly define the projects primary and secondary AOIs;
iii.	conduct E&amp;S baseline studies, including modeling of baseline conditions;
iv.	based on the above, prepare a ESIA report consistent with requirements of applicable local E&amp;S regulations, IFC 2012 PS, and WBG Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Guidelines. The ESIA will include action plans, management and monitoring programs, and an estimated implementation budget. Mitigation actions will include those specifically designed to address the circumstances of vulnerable project affected persons and groups;
v.	based on a clear rationale/justification of need, propose supplemental studies such as a biodiversity assessment (including multi-season species sampling and habitat change monitoring), indigenous peoples development plan and/or community development plan, influx management plan, etc;
vi.	prepare a summary ESIA report to be used with the full report in public consultations; and 
vii.	design, carry out, and document the public/stakeholder consultations and engagement throughout the ESIA process at key milestone stages (e.g. at scoping; at pre-finalization of draft ESIA; etc). This will include developing and conducting a robust, representative, iterative, and effective program of stakeholder identification, analysis, consultation, and engagement, including local disclosure activities and establishing grievance mechanisms which can be effectively accessed by project affected stakeholders. The above should also lead to preparation of: (i) the projects grievance redress mechanisms and channels; and (ii) a project Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), annexed to the ESIA main report. Vulnerable groups/persons should be included in the stakeholder identification and analysis.
