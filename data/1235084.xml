ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Kaduna State is a Northern State in Nigeria with a population estimated at 8 million, on the Lagos-Kano corridor. Kaduna State used to be a major industrial center in Nigeria, but its industry base has been declining since the 1980s. The Kaduna State Government has embarked on an ambitious modernization program, i.e. the Kaduna State Development Plan 2016-2020, with a strong focus on attracting private sector investments. The Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency (KADIPA) was established in 2016, with the mandate, in particular, to drive the development of Public Private Partnerships (PPP).

This assignment aims to support Kaduna State Government efforts, through KADIPA, to attract private investments in infrastructure through PPP. The assignment includes the following activities:
(1) PPP Pipeline Identification and Prioritization, with the following outputs: (i) PPP Pipeline Identification Report; (ii) PPP Screening Guidelines and Scoring Model; (iii) PPP Prioritization Report; 
(2) Project Scoping Analysis: three projects will be selected for more detailed scoping analysis. The scoping analysis will provide the basis to determine the viability and potential structure of the three projects;
(3) Institutional Diagnostic and Capacity Building, with the following outputs: (i) Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Diagnostic and Action Plan; (ii) Long-Term Strategy for Infrastructure Planning and PPP Pipeline Development; Guidance Materials for KADIPA PPP Unit and Ministries, Departments and Agencies.
