COUNTRY SOCIAL ANALYSIS
REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST 

Among the biggest policy challenges leaders face today is increasing social inclusion in both the process and benefits of economic growth. Research demonstrates that promoting social inclusion and reducing inequality can strengthen growth and make it more resilient  but the right institutions and polices must be in place to translate strong growth into better living standards. Conversely, exclusion from basic services, infrastructure, and economic opportunities, constrains productivity and traps people in poverty. In countries that have experienced recent conflict, social exclusion constitutes an additional risk as a potential driver of renewed conflict.
The Georgia CSA is based on the premise that not all groups benefit equally from development and growth and some may be left behind. Specifically, the CSA sets out to examine the social, cultural, and political factors defining exclusion/inclusion in Georgias society. Understanding the social factors for exclusion/inclusion is important: (i) in order to have a comprehensive understanding of obstacles to poverty and shared prosperity; and (ii) to be able to design and implement inclusive policies that also contribute rather than jeopardize cohesion and stability. Designing inclusive policies is particularly important given Georgias diversity, geo-political context, and recent history of conflict. 
The Georgia Country Social Analysis (CSA) has the broad objective to provide a comprehensive mapping of sources of social exclusion in Georgia, investigate drivers of exclusion, and suggest policy directions for enhancing inclusive growth. 

The World Bank is seeking a Consultant teams to perform the following activities:

1.	Mapping of exclusion 
Conduct background research and interviews and produce an exclusion mapping based and agreed categories, and analysis to understand: (i) Who are the most excluded groups? In what ways are they excluded (e.g. from infrastructure, services, labor markets, voice, representation, etc.)? Where do multiple forms of exclusion overlap? (ii) What factors drive and/or perpetuate exclusion (physical/geographic; social and cultural; economic; political, etc.)? (iii) How do current policies address these sources of exclusion? In what way can data and policies be improved to better address and monitor the inclusiveness of economic growth in Georgia? 
This component of the research will be based on: 
o	Background literature review  academic, policy, and development research ; available quantitative (survey) and analysis;  
o	Policy and institutional review  state policies and institutions addressing identified issues of exclusion; including brief review of non-state (NGO, international) programs addressing the same issues in the country;
o	Interviews with national and local policy-makers, service providers, international development, and civil society institutions;



2.	Qualitative research 
Together with World Bank team, select 3 case study themes and conduct targeted focus group discussions and interviews in selected urban and rural areas of Georgia to understand perception of different groups on drivers of exclusion. 

3.	A stakeholder consultation in Tbilisi
Organize a roundtable discussion to present and gather feedback on preliminary findings from the research. 

The final Output from this consultancy will be a report in English (of research and record of stakeholder consultation) by June 15, 2015. Intermediary outputs and deadlines will be specified in the Terms of Reference for this assignment.
