Assignment Countries:
  - (countries have not yet been selected)

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

IPDET - the International Program for Training and Development (www.ipdet.org) is in its 16th year and the objective of this assignment is to renew IPDETs two-week core course design and delivery approach, primarily involving its course curriculum, and laying the groundwork for IPDET 2.0.   It will build on the very successful existing course approach and design, to develop and propose new elements that would introduce pedagogical and delivery innovations where needed. Following recommendations from a 2015 strategic review of IPDET, along with the growing and changing needs among the M&amp;E community over 15 years, the program sponsors (The Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank Group and Carleton University), co-directors and management team wish to build on IPDETs accomplishments and to position it for the next 15 years.  A consulting firm will be hired by the World Bank, which will be the project manager for this assignment.
 
The primary activity of this assignment involves refreshing the core course curriculum (IPDET 2.0) to address the contemporary professional development needs of IPDET participants going forward, in the context of todays learning opportunities and methods.  The firm envisioned to take on this work will have previous experience in developing related M&amp;E training materials, with expertise that they can bring both in content (i.e., methods, developing country context, multicultural delivery) and pedagogy (i.e., though an instructional designer).   If the firm does not have on its team full-time staff who have done this work, they may bring on subcontractors, ideally with whom the firm has had a previous relationship. 
 
Note that the assignment only involves adjustments to the core course, i.e., the first two weeks of the four week IPDET program.  Though the consultants may offer advice on adjustments to the specialized workshop program during the latter two weeks of IPDET, this is not part of the assignment.
 
Throughout, the consultants will engage with a team of others whose views they would be asked to seek and consider when developing their proposals for refreshing of the course (e.g., IPDET sponsors and management team, instructional designer/s, content experts, peer reviewers, instructors, stakeholders in the donor community). 
 
A summary of the main supporting activities envisioned (though the consultants are invited to propose alternate arrangements) is below.
 
1. Review and, if needed, redefine the main target groups of participants and their needs
2. Engage with stakeholders, both directly and at a distance, in appreciation of the broad interest and ownership in the IPDET course globally
3. Develop the roadmap(s) for the curriculum to be designed around participant needs
4. Design the curriculum with an engaging pedagogical approach that optimizes ways and formats to address participants learning needs
5. Develop/revise the core content, following the roadmap(s), building on the existing curriculum, to provide foundational M&amp;E knowledge and contribute to improved quality of M&amp;E work undertaken by participants after leaving the course
6. Engage with peer reviewers
7. Prepare guidance for instructors who will teach the course and pilot parts of it in the June-July 2016 offering
8. Organize and deliver a training of trainers (ToT) session with instructors 
9. Prepare the arrangements for further refinement during and after the delivery of IPDET 2.0
10. Produce the final package of materials
