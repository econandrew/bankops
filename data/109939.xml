ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1209091 - Consultancy Services for Third Party Monitoring for the TDPERP

Assignment Countries:
  - Pakistan

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

In response to militancy, in June 2014 the Pakistan Army launched a second security operation in five FATA Agencies, namely North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Orakzai, Kurram and Khyber. Approximately 340,000 families were displaced. With success of military operations in most areas, the Government has started the TDPs repatriation process. The World Bank has provided support to the Government of Pakistan (GoP) through the FATA Temporarily Displaced Persons Emergency Recovery Project (TDP ERP) to support early recovery of families affected by the militancy crisis, promote child health, and strengthen emergency response safety net delivery systems in affected areas of FATA. A Project Management Unit (PMU) is being established by the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) to serve as the central coordination platform between NADRA, the lead implementation agency and key FATA government agencies.
The project has three main components:
	Early Recovery Grant (ERG) and Livelihood Support Grant (LSG)
	Promoting child health in selected areas of FATA through Child Wellness Grants (CWG)
	Strengthening program management and oversight
To address the access and security challenges and strengthen the program oversight, the World Bank is looking to engage third party monitoring to support the Bank activities in FATA. In particular, the firm will be an additional layer of oversight to strengthen Bank supervision tasks performed periodically under the project.
The firms task will be to periodically monitor selected project activities and inputs/ outputs in the aforementioned agencies of FATA. This will include (i) periodic review of operational processes, activities, outputs, and results in the field; (ii) comparing the processes and activities  outlined in the Project Operations Manual to those being implemented in practice, to identify any deviations as well as areas where additional attention may be warranted. The firm will be expected to perform regular monitoring of operations at the One-Stop-Shops established by the implementation agency. The monitoring and oversight methodology will include periodic visits to project sites as well as interviews with beneficiaries and if required with local government officials, local institutions and communities. 
The selected consultant shall provide solid evidence, including photographs, data, and recorded interviews to support the monitoring reports for all the monitoring and oversight activities carried out. The consultant will be required to provide periodic reports and recommendations for the project, specifically highlighting: 
	Implementation aspects to inform whether project is on track, compliant with the implementation plan, and consistent with the implementation agencies reports;
	Any issues for which corrective action can be taken on a timely basis.
	Safeguards related issues, including compliance with the projects Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP).
