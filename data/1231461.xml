Among the activities proposed to be supported by SPEIG is the design and implementation support for a comprehensive modernization program of the petroleum and gas sector in Egypt (Modernization program). Phase 1 of the Modernization Program has been completed, where a comprehensive design of key priorities for Modernization Program have been finalized - (1) Enhancing investment attraction through streamlining concession agreements;(2) Sector restructuring into separate policy, regulatory and operational entities;(3) Improving its human resource practices;(4) Optimizing downstream performance;(5)redesigning its upstream contractual frameworks, and enhance operational efficiency across value chain of oil and gas network; and(6)Promoting Egypt as a regional gas hub. These prioritized activities are intended to attain the three objectives of reducing fiscal deficit, attract private sector capital especially foreign investments in the petroleum and gas sector in Egypt, and demonstrate a role model for improving public sector governance within Egypt. In addition, a detailed institutional structure with a fully staffed (Modernization Realization Office "RO") as the core nucleus of the program has been set up, along with pre-identified activities as quick wins over 3-9 months backed by a strategic communications program.

OBJECTIVE
This 12-month assignment will assist the Ministry of Petroleum (MoP) in Egypt with the overall program management of the comprehensive 'Modernization Program' of the country's petroleum and gas sector.
