ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1236158 - Identifying the Role of the Private Sector in Climate Change Adaptation in Honduras

Assignment Countries:
  - Honduras 

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The overall objective of this consultancy is to assess the potential role for the private sector in climate change adaptation in Honduras. 

The study will identify climate risks associated to the areas of intervention for the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in the country that are relevant to the private sector (water management and infrastructure, agriculture and food security, meteorological knowledge management and climate data). Based on the identified risks, the study will consider how the private sector, including commercial banks,  can protect themselves from those climate risks as well as deliver essential products and services to help communities and businesses tackle climate challenges. The study will also analyze the existing enabling environment and market barriers that prevent the private sector from engaging in climate adaptation. Moreover, the study will identify potential private sector investments.
