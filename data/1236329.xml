ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: Selection of Legal Consultant for Grid-Tied Solar PV Projects in Bangladesh

Assignment Countries: Bangladesh

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The power sector in Bangladesh has grown rapidly over the last decade, maximum generation increased from a little over 3,000 MW in 2009 to more than 8,000 MW in 2016. However, supply still lags behind peak demand resulting in demand curtailment particularly in the rural areas. Annual per capita energy consumption in Bangladesh is relatively low at 407 kWh, compared to 1,010 kWh for India, 2,600 kWh for China, and 13,246 kWh for the United States. However, Bangladesh has been successful in increasing access to electricity from less than 50% a decade ago to 76% today, including about 14% from renewable energy.

Considerable challenges, however, remains for ensuring that people connected to the grid get uninterrupted electricity supply. The primary challenge is that Bangladesh's reserves of natural gas, which accounts for about 67% of power generation, are estimated to deplete from 2020 if no new gas reserves are discovered. Considering the depleting gas reserves, the Government of Bangladesh ("GoB") is targeting to reduce its single source dependency on gas and has initiated fuel diversification measures to achieve an efficient mix of gas, oil, coal, and renewable energy as per the Power System Master Plan 2010.

Particularly, on renewable energy, Bangladesh still lags behind in its efforts to tap into potential grid-tied electricity generation despite the tremendous success of its off-grid renewable energy program. Installed renewable energy generation capacity is currently 430MW, with the 230MW Kaptai Hydropower project being the only grid-connected renewable energy resource, and the remaining is mostly from off-grid solar homes in rural areas. To increase the generation through renewable energy, GoB has taken a systematic approach by formulation of relevant policies and targets. As per the National Renewable Energy Policy 2008 ("NREP"), generation capacity of 2,000 MW is planned to be added by 2020 from renewable sources. GoB has also set renewable energy development targets for several technologies for each year from 2015 to 2021 ("RE Development Targets"). Furthering the ambitions of NREP, the RE Development Targets call for an additional 3,100 MW of renewable energy capacity to be installed by 2021. Most of the new capacity is planned from solar (1,676 MW, or 54%) and wind (1,370 MW, or 44%). 

Despite the government commitment, there has been no utility-scale solar PV projects delivered in Bangladesh. A number of unsolicited proposals for grid-tied solar totaling around 500 MW were received by the Power Division over the past few years but none of the projects awarded is expected to come in operation anytime soon due to difficulties in obtaining land by the private sector and the inexperience of some of the companies. About 15 MW in solar rooftop PV systems have been installed in the main cities as a result of a government requirement for a certain percentage of lighting loads to come from solar for getting a new grid connection. However, most of these panels were installed to comply with the requirement to get a new grid connection and there were inadequate quality control and monitoring to ensure that quality panels were installed. As a result, most of this capacity produces little or no energy. 

Under such circumstances, IFC is currently in discussion with the Power Division and Power Cell under the Ministry of Power, Energy &amp; Mineral Resources ("MPEMR") to bring private sector investment in solar power generation through, i) ground mounted utility scale solar PV projects across multiple sites in Bangladesh, and ii) grid-tied rooftop solar PV projects across different cities ("Projects"). IFC plans to undertake the feasibility of the above Projects in terms of technical, environmental &amp; social, legal, and financial viability. Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, IFC may continue to provide transaction advisory services to facilitate selection of private sector partner(s) to develop the Projects on PPP basis, and till the Projects achieves financial closure. 

To assist IFC for this Projects, IFC intends to hire a Legal Consultant to advise IFC on the legal and regulatory due diligence and to work in coordination with IFC and its other advisers, dedicating sufficient qualified resources to meet the deliverables and the timetable. The broad scope of the Legal Consultant comprises the following but is not limited to:

1. Conduct a legal and regulatory due diligence in order to assess applicable legal &amp; regulatory framework and identify any legal and regulatory issues that may impact a private sector party (foreign/local) to implement and operate the project;
2. Undertake due diligence of the sites (land/rooftop) identified for setting up the proposed Projects, including review of the land/rooftop title (ownership) documents and suitability of such project in the identified location under the existing legal framework; 
3. Review existing laws/regulations in the sector related to power generation, evacuation, and transmission, tariff policy, existing off-take arrangement, regulatory mechanism, review relevant national laws such as labor laws, environment regulations etc. and commercial regulations such as insurance, taxation, subsidy etc.; and identify any potential regulatory risks and establish an appropriate payment mechanism and a monitoring mechanism; 
4. Identify any approvals and authorizations required for the Projects; develop the key principles of the project agreements and also ensure inclusion of bankable provisions, develop risk mitigation measures, and develop a tariff setting mechanism, if required;
5. Study the existing PPP policies &amp; framework, and evaluate PPP options, outlining roles and responsibilities of different parties and assist IFC in selecting the most practical option by recommending a PPP structure for the transaction;
6. Assist in developing bidding parameter and the evaluation criteria, prepare bidding documents (which could include the RFQ, RFP, Power Purchase Agreement, Implementation Agreement etc.), address the legal queries raised during the bidding stage, and assist IFC in bid processing for selection of the private investor;
7. Provide legal opinions, if necessary, supported with legal precedents and case laws on any aspect of the bid process that may require clarifications at any point during the bidding process; and
8. The Legal Consultant will be expected to liaise with government authorities and other agencies to get the necessary data for carrying out the assignment.

Detailed Terms of Reference will be provided at the Request for Proposal Stage.
