Since the Egypt ADR project is expected to close in June 2016, the publication and dissemination of these materials will be essential to ensuring the sustainability of results achieved by the Egypt ADR project.

B.	BACKGROUND

About the World Bank Group: The World Bank Group (also referred to as Bank or World Bank in this document) offers loans, advice, and an array of customized resources to more than 100 developing countries and countries in transition. The World Bank Group comprises five institutions (IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, ICSID) managed by their member countries. Established in 1944, the World Bank Group is headquartered in Washington, D.C. 

The World Bank Groups Finance &amp; Markets Global Practice: The Finance &amp; Markets  Global Practice delivers comprehensive World Bank Group solutions, including World Bank loans/credits, guarantees, and risk-management products and WB and IFC knowledge, advisory, and convening services to public sector clients. 

The Egypt Alternative Dispute Resolution Project (Project): Resolution of commercial disputes through courts in Egypt takes an average of 1010 days (World Bank Groups Doing Business 2015 report). Alternatives to the court system were sought by the private sector and the government. This culminated in a strong arbitration practice, mainly exercised through the Cairo Regional Center for International Commercial Arbitration (CRCICA) and supported by a first-class arbitration law. Given the high cost of arbitration, and the continuous lengthy court proceedings, the government of Egypt has worked towards implementing mediation as an alternative to courts. In 2008, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) established the Economic Courts where judges offer and assist parties towards reaching settlement at the pre-trial stage. The Ministry of Investment established in 2009 a center for the resolution of investors disputes that falls under the General Authority for Investment (GAFI). 

In late 2009, IFC/World Bank Group started the Egypt Alternative Dispute Resolution Project to promote the use of commercial mediation with CRCICA, the MOJ and GAFI as clients. The objective of the project was to train and accredit mediators to an international standard, train trainers to ensure sustainability of the training, raise the clients capacity to attract and manage mediation cases, and raise public recognition of the use of mediation as an alternative method of dispute resolution. Since 2009, IFC/World Bank Group project team has supported the development of mediation practice in Egypt through providing professional training and certification for mediators (through the London-based Center for Effective Dispute Resolution), mediation awareness-raising workshops, review of CRCICA and GAFI mediation rules, study trips to jurisdictions with well established mediation practice, and most recently assistance with the drafting of Egypts first Mediation Law.  

To date, the development outcomes are: (1) reduction in the time of resolving commercial disputes measured against baseline data for resolving disputes through the courts based on DB data (time: from 1010 days in the court to 90 days through ADR); (2) increase in the number of cases successfully settled through mediation to 60 cases (3 years post project completion); and (3) creation of a peer-to-peer network between mediation institutions for continuous knowledge sharing and sustainability of mediation.

The Egypt ADR project is expected to close in June 2016. This year, the Egypt ADR Project has invested significantly in the knowledge material to ensure availability of training and reference material on ADR, especially in view of the scarcity of available material covering mediation in Arabic. Therefore, a series of booklets called Mediation Essentials (9 booklets total) were developed, covering the basic tenets of mediation, providing international judicial trends in mediation, and guidance on how to develop mediation policy. Six of the booklets are now in the final form and being translated and edited.
