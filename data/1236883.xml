ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1236883 - Ethiopia - GIS Least-cost planning and related capacity building for Ethiopia for Grid and Off Grid Rollout

Assignment Countries:
  - Ethiopia

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

Establishment of two GIS platforms to support DOE functions and EEU planning. The platforms will initially require the purchasing of basic hardware and software (1 computer, 1 server, 1 ArcGIS software per platform), and capacity building to provide the basis background for GIS-based planning and monitoring.  It is suggested to have one GIS specialist within the DOE as well as one within EEU to improve the utilitys planning capabilities. Over time, and in parallel with the modeling, adoption and implementation of a geospatial least-cost plan, GIS capacity and capability will be expanded and strengthened, particularly at the EEU level as the main implementing agency for grid rollout, in collaboration with and under the oversight of the DOE (Phase 2). The Consultant for capacity building could also conduct  in collaboration with the two GIS Specialists - an assessment of the costs associated with the expansion of GIS capacity (to occur under Phase 2) into a well-functioning and structured unit.

The GIS specialist in the DOE is expected to liaise closely with the EEUs Department of UEAP and Distribution Operations to address data and methodology issues. During the first phase, the two Specialists will be trained on the use of GIS tools and standard operating, communication and monitoring procedures for the establishment of a working and collaborative relationship between the two counterparts at DOE and EEU necessary for the implementation and update of the least-cost plan. Furthermore, the focus of initial activities will be directed toward gathering GIS data layers sourced from various GOE ministries (Health, Education, Industry, agriculture, Census, Mapping Agency, and Local Governments) and assess possible data gaps.

The GIS specialist in EEU will build upon UEAP operational expertise and take stock, consolidate and harmonize the GIS network mapping already available from the implementation of the Program and assess gaps, possible inconsistencies and any other relevant data issue. The GIS Specialist will become the focal point for the future expansion of the platform within EEU.

The total cost for the initial establishment of both platforms, including capacity building, is estimated not to exceed US$120,000.
