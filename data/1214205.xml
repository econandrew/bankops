ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

Assignment Title: 1214205 - Consultant for Philippine Green Building

Assignment Countries:
  - Philippines

ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

The Project: The overall objective of the program is to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy, water and other resource efficiencies associated with new building construction and retrofitting of existing buildings. Through a programmatic approach and in partnership with the government, the private sector and like-minded organizations, the program will help address market failures and major barriers in developing and implementing green buildings in the Philippines.  

The project promotes and implements the IFCs Green Building Market Transformation Program, which has 3 components: 1) development and implementation of pilot city GB regulations; 2) development and implementation of national green building regulations; and 3) implementation of the EDGE certification system.  The Philippine GB Code and Mandaluyong City GB ordinance are now in place.  The EDGE program is yet to be launched. It seeks to address the gap in the market for a simple green building standard and a low-cost certification system. As part of the EDGE Program, IFC has developed an assessment instrument (the EDGE Tool) that can be used to identify financially viable alternatives for developing a green building project at the early design stage. The EDGE Tool offers options that lead to a set of technical solutions to reduce the consumption of energy, water, and embodied energy in building materials, calculating upfront costs and potential operational savings.

The Green Building Program is looking for an individual consultant to assist the Project leader in program implementation, subject to the following terms and conditions.

Scope of work: The GB Consultant reports directly to the Project Leader of the Philippine Green Building Project and will work closely with the DPWH, Mandaluyong City and other government partners, the private sector and professional organizations, the EDGE local partner and the GB project team, which includes the EAP Regional Green Building Specialist, Global Green Building Specialist, EDGE Team and other IFC and WBG Staff resources. The GB Consultant shall provide insights into concrete green building issues and challenges faced in the design and implementation of green building concept (and EDGE Tools) in the Philippines.  The primary focus of the work will be public awareness and capacity building to promote and implement Green Building and the EDGE Tools.
