      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION

This study will baseline the structure and value of current tourism demand, assess the current PNG marketing offer and its impact, provide a market outlook for tourism in PNG over the next 10 years and evaluate the strategic options available to the government to grow demand from appropriate target markets by evaluating their size, value and preferences.
