      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      In DRC, IFC has invested in 27 SMEs in the sectors of retail, education, healthcare, and logistics.

Requirements: proved track record in conducting value chin analysis, French-speaking, excellent written English, experience working in Central Africa.
      
      Scope of Work:
      SMEs are often seen as a key driver behind job creation. However, access to finance is a key challenge for SMEs in many developing countries around the world  hindering their growth and consequently job creation critical to sustainable economic growth. The CASF fund is one of the six SME Venture funds, which aims to tackle this barrier by providing financing and advisory services to 27 high-growth SMEs in the DRC in areas of retail, education, logistics, transportation, and public health.
      CASA and SME Ventures Program are looking for a short-term consultant to develop a full mapping of all critical components of a value chain map for each of 27 investee firms. The information will be used to estimate the feasibility to estimate the number of indirect jobs for all 27 SMES.
      
      For purposes of this assignment, the consultant will clearly define the scope of the value chain to be studied, in particular clarifying the following:
      - Vertical scope of the chain: in most cases, all stages of value addition in the product/service, from basic inputs through to final sale and disposal/recycling will be studied.
      - While the value chain strictly covers vertical stages of activity related and supporting activities are involved in all value chains  including supply chain and support services such as transport and logistics, financial and business services; research, training, etc.  whole employment will be affected by dynamics in the core value chain.
      
      Deliverables:
      - A value chain map for each firm and recommendation
      - A sample selection for the next stage of research - specifically, job estimation.
