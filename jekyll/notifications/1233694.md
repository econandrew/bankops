      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank Group, and ESMAP team, in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Commerce and Blue Economy  of São Tomé and Príncipe, are launching the first Global Energy Access household Survey in access deficit. The survey would set a baseline to track progress towards Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) goal and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number seven on access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy by 2030, and an overall baseline for the Power Sector Recovery Project IDA D1260.
      The Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe is a small island state comprising two main volcanic islands and several islets located off the west coast of Central Africa in the Gulf of Guinea. Sao Tome, the largest island, covers an area of 859 km2 and has around 180,000 inhabitants, Principe Island, situated 150 km to the North, covers about 142 km2 and has around 7,500 inhabitants. The country is divided into six districts (Agua Grande, Cantagalo, Caué, Lembá, Lobata, and Mé-Zóchi) plus the Autonomous Region of Príncipe, which has been self-governed since 1995.
      Access to electricity in São Tomé and Príncipe has increased from 53% to 61% of the population from 2000 to 2012. However, this access is concentrated in the urban areas (68%) with rural areas lagging behind (47%) . Electricity access is more widespread among non-poor families (58%) than poorer families (48%). While there is no available data on the quantity or duration of power cuts, service quality is widely acknowledged as unreliable and extensive outages are frequent, especially during periods of peak demand. This limited supply, even to those connected to the grid, leaves only privately owned diesel of gasoline generators for reliable supply, which results in a costly and unsustainable proposition for household budgets and private sector growth. Kerosene is a frequent recourse for lighting in both poor household (42%) and in relatively non-poor households (32%). The use of other energy sources varies widely, with 74% of household in rural areas using firewood or charcoal for cooking, compared to 35% in urban areas. The low rate of access to non-solid fuels for cooking, estimated at 29%  has an impact on pollution from solid fuel stoves which can cause eye problems and respiratory diseases. 
      A reputed firm with extensive experience in household and, preferably, expertise on energy sector is sought to conduct the household, community/facility and enterprise baseline survey on energy access in São Tomé and Príncipe using the multi-tier framework approach to track progress towards SDG7 and SE4ALL goal. The survey will be nationally representative and administered to both urban and rural localities. The firm will work with the World Bank-ESMAP to pre-test, finalize and implement the survey. Data collection should be carefully monitored to ensure high quality information. The firm will provide capacity building to the National Institute of Statistics (Institute Nacional de Estatísticas ) and the Ministry of Finance, Commerce and Blue Economy to ensure continuity on tracking of energy indicators. After completing the fieldwork, the firm will deliver the final dataset and summary report to the World Bank-ESMAP.  Additional details on the scope of work will be available in the Terms of Reference (TOR). 
      Interested firms should provide a brief summary of their qualifications to perform the services (maximum of 3 pages). The short-listing criteria will be based on:
      1.	Experience in carrying out household and enterprise surveys in Sub-Saharan Africa, and specific experience in São Tomé and Príncipe is highly desirable;
      2.	Experience in the energy and other infrastructure sectors (e.g. water and sanitation); 
      3.	In-depth understanding of the energy access sector and its socio-economic dimensions; 
      4.	Strong technical skills in qualitative/quantitative research and data analysis; 
      5.	Proven skill in using CAPI-tablet based data collection ;
      6.	Cultural awareness in dealing with local communities, and interacting with government and local authorities;  and,
      7.	Excellent writing and analytical and presentation skills in English and Portuguese.
      
      Preference will be giving to local firms with high knowledge of the country sector and socio-economic context, also, international firms are encouraged to team up with local partners. The assignment should start in February 2017 and it is expected to be completed by end of May 2017.
