      (CONSULTING SERVICES  FIRMS SELECTION)
      
      Colombia has given concrete steps to address green growth. The country has started the process of accession to OECD because, in 2012, Colombia adhered to the OECDs Green Growth Declaration. This Declaration urges countries to encourage green investment and sustainable management of natural resources, through various policy instruments aimed at a low carbon economy; to promote policy reforms with the aim of avoiding or removing environmentally harmful policies that might thwart green growth, such as subsidies; to consider the requirements with respect to social and human capital (green jobs); and strengthening the role of international cooperation in this field, considering the principles of free trade and investments. 
      
      In response to this commitment, the Colombia National Development Plan 2014-2018 (NDP) establishes Green Growth (GG) as an overarching strategy to reach both peace and sustainable development. The Law that enacted the NDP (law 1753 of 2015) mandates the National Government to formulate a Green Growth Policy that will define the objectives, goals and policy measures for setting Colombia in a path of sustainable economic growth. Further, on January 2016 started the implementation of the new Agenda for Sustainable Development, and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which establishes 17 objectives and 169 goals that encompass the economic, social and environmental spheres of development. The GG Policy will enable the fulfillment of a large part of these objectives as well as to the country commitments included in it National Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement on climate change.
      
      Under this framework, the National Planning Department is developing the "Green Growth Mission", with the aim of preparing and discussing the technical inputs needed to formulate a long-term Green Growth Policy that defines growth objectives and targets Economic development by 2030. Diagnostic and prospective studies will be carried out within the framework of this Mission to identify policy options that incorporate a green growth approach into the country's development planning, promoting economic competitiveness, conservation and efficient use of natural resources, climate-friendly growth and greater social inclusion.
      
      The World Bank, with funds from the KOREAN GREEN GROWTH PARTNERSHIP is supporting to the Government of Colombias (GoC) efforts to formulate and start-up the implementation of its Green Growth policy. In that context, the World Bank seeks the services of a consulting firm for carrying out a study to identify and propose targets for renewable energies and energy efficiency in Colombia, as well as the strategies and instruments that allow them to be achieved, in order to be considered in the formulation of the long-term Green Growth Policy within the framework of the Green Growth Mission that will be prepared by the National Planning Department.

      	Unconventional renewable energy sources (FERNC) to be considered are, as a minimum: solar, wind, biomass, and small hydropower plants at the edge of water.
