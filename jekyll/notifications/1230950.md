      World Bank Group is hiring a firm whose task will be to conduct a study for extension of pension coverage to the informal sector workers in Uganda.
      The main purpose of the study is to address the essential factors behind the underlying barriers hindering coverage to the informal sector. The diagnostic will include an analysis not only of the existing pension system, but also of the wider financial sector (mobile money, informal sector banking and savings, relevant insurance products) and other relevant issues (national ID) to try and identify innovative and evolving savings mechanisms, which could potentially be utilized by the pension sector.
