      Request for Expression of Interest (EoI) - Yemen Damage and Needs Assessment Phase 2
      
      
      Summary
      
      The firms assignment is to support Yemen Dynamic Damage and Needs Assessment by providing a variety of remote-based assessment methods, including satellite imagery analysis, (social) media analytics, data mining and analysis of publicly available information, to validate and corroborate the primary data collection process and to fill in potential data gaps. 
      
      Background
      
      The World Bank Group plans to undertake the second phase of the Yemen Dynamic Damage and Needs Assessment (DNA), which was initiated in September 2015 to assess the impact of the Yemeni crisis on key infrastructure and service delivery. 
      
      After the successful completion of the first phase, which covered four cities and six sectors (health, education, energy, water and sanitation, transport and housing), the second phase will cover an expanded geographical and sectoral scope and rely on a mix of ground-based and remote-based assessment methods. 
      
      Assignment
      
      The key objective of the Damage & Needs Assessment (DNA) is to inform the Bank and the international community of the effect of the crisis on the population, physical assets, and infrastructure as well as conduct a preliminary estimate of physical infrastructure reconstruction needs for post-crisis recovery in Yemen. 
      
      The second phase of the Yemen DNA will rely on remote information source that may include but not limited to satellite imagery analysis, (social) media analytics, data mining, analysis of publicly available information for spot checks and verification purposes. The analysis is likely to cover the following sectors: education, health, water and sanitation, energy, transport, housing, and information and communications technology (ICT) services.
