      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Government of India has prioritized rural sanitation under the recently launched Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBM)  Clean India Campaign with a prime objective of making India Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2019.  To support achievement of SBM (rural) targets, the World Bank will provide a USD 1.5 billion loan to the Government of India. In addition, a programmatic Technical Assistance (TA) has been initiated, to strengthen SBM-G program delivery institutions at the national level, and in select states in planning, implementing and monitoring of the program for achieving reduction of open defecation, sustaining open defecation free -status of villages and increasing villages with solid and liquid management. 
      In Rajasthan, the local governments have demonstrated successful approaches of scaling up sanitation in a number of districts. The Panchayati Raj Department, the nodal department for implementing SBM, has already initiated the process of scaling up the successful approaches to all 33 districts in the state. 
      
      The objective of this assignment is to engage a firm to support the Panchayati Raj Department of Rajasthan to establish Technical Support Unit (TSU) for SBM at the state level for a period of two years, with a provision to extend services for one more year. 
      
      The TSU will provide overall SBM program management support, including strengthening institutional capacity in areas like planning, service delivery, monitoring, financial flows, behavioral change communication , capacity building, solid and liquid waste management, knowledge management and verification systems and any other areas of demand as expressed by the state. It will work directly with the Panchayti Raj department, coordinate with district level functionaries and other stakeholders in the State and build and maintain strong partnerships with development partners that work at scale. 
      The firm shall provide qualified and experienced professionals to be part of the TSU. It is estimated that a minimum of six state level consultants be engaged by the consultant firm in the TSU. The consultants hired for the TSU through this assignment will report to the State Coordinator of the World Bank's TA as well as the concerned government officers. 
      
      The assignment is proposed as time and material contract. Attendance/time spent by consultants will be monitored for making payments. While some of the consultants are required to work full time from the office of Panchayati Raj department, others may be required to work independently, depending on the requirements of the position
