      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The objective of the Assignment is to support the World Banks operational engagement regarding national and regional legal and regulatory environments for official identification systems and civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS). It will include work on assessments with client countries (e.g. dialogue, technical assistance and lending operations) to improve official identification systems and CRVS in the following interconnected ways:
      	Country and regional engagement: Lead or support assessments of the national- and/or regional-level legal and regulatory environment for official identification systems and CRVS, based on a standardized legal safeguards checklist/guidance note. 
      	Normative work: Provide technical inputs into the development of a legal and regulatory framework of enabling standards and building blocks for official identification systems and CRVS, as well as inputs into the continued development of the standardized legal safeguards checklist/guidance note.
      
      The key output of the Consulting Assignment is the development and support for enhanced legal and regulatory arrangements for official identification systems and CRVS. The Consulting Assignment will be oriented around activities and outputs necessary to foster and promote trust in their design, implementation and use of electronic identity management systems and CRVS, especially in the areas of data security, individual privacy and data protection, non-discrimination and inclusion, e-commerce and e-transaction, cybercrime and cyber security.  
      
      The Consulting Assignment will cover the following regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, Latin American, and the Middle East and North Africa. It is expected that 70% of the assignment will take place in the Pacific Islands and Africa, with the remaining 30% distributed among the other regions (rest of the world). 
      
      The Consulting Assignment is expected to run until June 2018, subject to an option to extend for additional periods as agreed.
