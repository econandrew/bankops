      We are seeking a firm to carry out a study with the objective of increasing the understanding of the linkages between poverty, forest dependence and rural energy use in Armenia in support of more informed and efficient public policy making, and development investments around forestry and energy in the country. The study will support the production of systematic, quantitative and repeatable information on the role of sustainable forest management for rural households. It will also inform the PROFOR Global Programmatic study, Understanding forests' contributions to poverty reduction (P156731) being carried out in parallel. Rural and urban households in Armenia, especially the poor and most vulnerable ones, rely on fuelwood to meet their heating and energy needs, as it remains the cheapest and most accessible energy source. Despite increasing gas network coverage across the country, when gas prices increase, the population increasingly switches to fuelwood.
