      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      IFC has been appointed as lead advisor to advise Ethiopian Electric Power to procure up to 500MW of solar PV on an IPP basis.  
      
      IFC is seeking a consultant to provide tax advice on the transaction.  The engagement will be split into two phases: Phase I - a due diligence and transaction structuring phase and Phase II - implementation and tendering.
      
      Phase 1 Objective: review and advise on applicable tax and accounting regimes and provide recommendations for the selected transaction structure
      
      Phase 2 Objective: respond to tax and accounting clarification questions of the potential bidders by providing technical input or answering queries of prospective bidders as required.
      
      Specifically, the envisioned tasks would include 
      Phase 1  Due diligence and transaction structuring
      1.	Analyse applicable tax laws, providing a summary of the applicable tax regime, including a list of all taxes which would, under the laws of Ethiopia (without taking into account the effects of any international taxation treaties), typically be required to be paid, collected or levied by a limited liability company established under the laws of Ethiopia to: 
      
      -	engage all necessary domestic or expatriate employees;
      -	be owned by one or more domestic or international investors who expect to remit dividends and/or shareholder loan repayments;
      -	raise finance from international banks and/or financial institutions;
      -	design, insure, construct, own, operate and maintain a generation facility which is similar to the proposed solar PV plants at the proposed sites;
      -	benefit from rights under agreements relating to the acquisition, grant or other provision of land for the project sites;
      -	engage contractors (whether domestic or international) employing such employees as such contractor considers necessary or appropriate; 
      -	use imported materials and equipment; and
      -	connect to the grid system and sell electricity.
      
      2.	Propose options for the structuring / shareholding of the project company for each project, based on the Consultants previous PPP experience and tax and accounting analysis, as well as the reports from the other consultants, recognising that for this project EEP is proposing to form the project companies itself and to sell / issue a majority shareholding in each company to the relevant winning bidder, with a view to retaining a minority shareholding (approximately 20%) in each company itself.
      
      3.	Provide details of any incentives potentially available to the projects, including but not limited to accelerate tax depreciation allowances or corporate income tax holidays.
      The output will be shared with all bidders in a competitive process to tender the project and will allow bidders to build their financial models to determine their bid tariff and for bidders/lenders to understand the tax and accounting implications of the Project.
      
      
      Phase 2  Implementation and tendering:
      
      1.	Provide relevant tax and accounting information for the Project to be included in the data room.
      
      2.	Assist IFC in reviewing and responding to questions and information requests regarding the tax and accounting documents uploaded in the data room.  
      
      3.	Assist IFC in reviewing the financial qualifications of Prospective Bidders during the initial prequalification process.
      
      4.	Assist IFC in reviewing the forecast equity amounts and maximum equity submitted by Prequalified Bidders, in accordance with the RFP requirements.
