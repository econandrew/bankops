      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      About CGAP												
      CGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) is an independent policy and research center dedicated to advancing financial inclusion for the world's poor. It is supported by over 30 development agencies and private foundations who share a common mission to alleviate poverty.  Housed at the World Bank, CGAP  provides market intelligence, promotes standards, develops innovative solutions and offers advisory services to governments, microfinance providers, donors, and investors.
      CGAP works toward a world in which poor people are considered valued clients of their countrys financial system.  We aim to help build efficient and equitable local financial markets that serve all poor people with convenient and affordable financial services. CGAPs 2014-2018 strategy (CGAP V) includes a focus on the following priority areas:
      	Understanding demand to effectively deliver for the poor, 
      	Advancing financial innovation for agriculture-dependent poor households, 
      	Developing robust country-level provider ecosystems, 
      	Building an enabling and protective policy environment globally and 
      	Promoting effective and responsible funding for financial inclusion. 
      
      CGAPs work on promoting effective and responsible funding for financial inclusion aims at improving the allocation and channeling of funding by public donors, DFIs and philanthropies to facilitate inclusive financial market. Significant amounts of financial and technical resources are dedicated toward building financially inclusive markets.  These resources have the potential to help realize this vision if properly allocated and managed.  Unfortunately, much of the funding allocated for financial inclusion does not achieve its catalytic role and may be hampering sound market development by creating dependency and redundancy. The CGAP funder guidance initiative aims to increase the effectiveness of cross-border funding by improving transparency on funding flows.  
      CGAP also works to support improved publically available data to serve the financial inclusion industry by providing reliable and publically available data.
