      IRAQ: Reimbursable Advisory Service for Structuring of the Gas Value Chain and Gas Marketing  Component II: Capacity Building
      
      REoI for Strategic Energy/Gas Capacity Building Consultant
      
      Iraq's Ministry of Oil (MoO)/Oil Marketing Company (SOMO) have entered into an agreement with the World Bank to provide assistance for the formulation and design of a framework to support the modernization of Iraq's natural gas value chain, including the sub-sectors policy, institutional, legal and regulatory systems, and gas infrastructure planning. 
      
      In June 2015, the World Bank agreed to support the Government of Iraq (GoI) achieve these goals through a Reimbursable Advisory Service (RAS). The RAS implementation, initiated in October 2015, has two components designed for implementation in consecutive phases: Component I (Analytical Work): analyzing Iraq's natural gas sector and developing recommendations and a roadmap to introduce appropriate policy, institutional, regulatory, commercial and contractual frameworks necessary to secure clear, robust, efficient and effective relationships between all stakeholders through the gas value chain, and Component II (Capacity Building): developing and implementing an interactive training and capacity building program for gas sector state institutions (MoO/SOMO).
      
      As Component I (Analytical Work) nears completion, this Request seeks to obtain expressions of interest from qualified institutions to provide the following services for Component II (Capacity Building):
      
      1. Identify training and capacity building activities and propose a prioritized 6-9 month program for implementation,
      
      2. Implement the program.
      
      The program should contemplate, in addition to the routinely-offered web-based and in person training courses, any of the following non-exhaustive activities: i) case study workshops and on-the-job training arrangements, ii) access to repositories of information and resources (e.g., publications, databases, libraries and membership websites), iii) site visits (e.g., international energy institutions, academic and energy research organizations, natural gas facilities and infrastructure), and iv) access to free or minimum cost short term secondment opportunities with industry organizations outside Iraq. 
      
      The beneficiaries of the program will include a cohort of 25-30 designated staff members of state institutions involved in the natural gas value chain (i.e., MoO/SOMO). Following the completion of the Capacity Building activities, this cohort will become the core and permanent staff of a Natural Gas Unit to be established within the Ministry of Oil and an International Gas Marketing Unit to be established in SOMO charged with applying cutting edge and successful practices in the development and management of the natural gas sector in Iraq and in international natural gas commercialization practices. 
      
      An estimated budget of up to US$1 million would be allocated for the program, which should cover all program activities in addition to travel, invitation and visa facilitation, accommodation and security arrangement costs for the trainees as well as for the Consultants staff and trainers. However, the Consultant will not bid by price, but by service.
      
      The Consultant will be responsible for obtaining relevant information and materials, contacting relevant organizations and arranging activities in accordance with the Consultants proposal. 
      
      The training and capacity building activities are expected to be conducted inside and outside Iraq, and by the Consultant or through its own arrangements.
      Interpretation and translation services (English-Arabic) should be made available to the trainees, if needed.
      
      Further background materials, including summaries of reports and studies generated from the RAS Analytical Work component, will be provided to the Consultant prior to commencing its activities, as requested.  
      
      The Consultant will have knowledge of all aspects of the gas industry necessary for the formulation and implementation of the capacity building program. Experience of high-level strategic consulting and training in the gas industry will be important.  
      
      The World Bank now invites eligible consultants to indicate their interest in providing these services (formulating and implementing a training and capacity building program). Interested consultants should provide information indicating their experience in delivering similar assignments for complex and large-scale energy systems and institutions. Strong expertise in the delivery of these services, with a focus on implementation, and taking into account technical, commercial, and institutional factors, will be required. The information supplied may include brochures, description of similar assignments, experience in similar conditions, educational networks and affiliated institutions, general qualifications and number of key staff. 
      
      Consultants may associate to enhance their qualifications.
      
      The expected duration for the Consultants required services will be approximately 6-9 calendar months, but subject to the satisfactory achievement of all required tasks.
      
      This REoI is for short listing only. A reputable international energy/gas consultant will be selected by the World Bank in accordance with the World Banks Guidelines.
