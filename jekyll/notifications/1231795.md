      II.	About IFCs Private Equity Group 
      IFC has been a pioneer in emerging market private equity since the late 1980s, helping it grow from a nascent market to a mainstream asset class.  Today IFC is one of the largest investors in the industry. Total private equity investment in emerging markets stands at approximately $320 billion  more than ever before, yet still just a tiny fraction of the $2.7 trillion global total. Building the industry further is a key part of IFCs mandate of supporting private sector development and promoting the development of strong local fund managers which provide risk capital to private companies, thereby spurring economic growth.  IFCs fund strategy focuses on investing in growth equity and venture capital funds across all emerging market regions, and IFC has a targeted program (SME Ventures) to develop such funds in frontier markets and fragile and conflict affected countries.
      
      III.	IFCs SME Ventures Program
      The SME Ventures Program helps to launch and invest in funds run by emerging fund managers which provide risk capital to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The Program combines investment in funds with advisory services to fund managers as well as technical assistance to SMEs in the funds portfolios.  The program is focused on fragile and conflict-affected countries , as well as other frontier markets (mainly International Development Agency (IDA) borrower countries ). The Program has invested in five funds in its Initial Phase and is being expanded.   
      
      SME Ventures is designed to increase the availability of risk capital to SMEs in difficult markets through the development of strong locally-based fund managers.  The Programs advisory component combines capacity building services and dissemination of best practices to strengthen managers investment and operational capabilities, and covers all aspects of fund management, including strategy, operational setup, corporate governance, environmental and social management systems, and portfolio management through exit.  The technical assistance component is designed to enable fund managers to provide value addition to the SMEs in the fund portfolios. 
      
      IV.	Scope of Work

      	Each project will involve diagnosing the managers existing capacity levels across the various aspects of fund management, including strategy, organizational structure, business development, client acquisition, investment due diligence, portfolio management, exit planning, and back-office operations.

      	Where external service providers or consultants are determined to be necessary for the capacity-building project (e.g., for financial management systems), the SME Fund Management Specialist will help select and supervise these consultants while delivering their assigned scope of work.
      	As IFC explores investments with additional managers, in coordination with the IFC Funds team, the SME Fund Management Specialist will help, on occasion, with the due diligence of prospective fund managers.
