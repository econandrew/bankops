      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1233125 - Costing of national identification systems
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      As countries seek to develop and roll out robust and inclusive national identification systems it is critical to develop estimations of the associated costs, for a number of reasons. Not only is an accurate estimation of costs critical to the decision-making process for a government, a favorable economic case could serve as compelling motivation beyond the archetypal social or security-related concerns. Moreover, if cost standards exist, governments are empowered with a reference base which can be used to evaluate procurement bids. Finally, understanding and accounting for the costs is the first step to developing a sustainable financing plan for providing identification services to ensure the longer term endurance of the system.
      
      Three major outputs are expected: 
      (1)	A costing database which lists actual available cost amounts for 20-30 developing countries across different phases of maturity of national identification systems (both investment and recurring) based on publicly available data and interviews with experts. This would be supported by an appendix of one-page profiles of 10 selected countries, to demonstrate the impact of key design choices on costs of national identification systems.
      (2)	An analysis which outlines the key variables which are the determinants of costs of national identification systems, across different phases of identity management. This would be supported by country examples across a range of contexts and ID system types.
      (3)	A costing model which estimates the cost ranges for different types of countries seeking to roll out various models of identification systems, through each phase of identification management and under a variety of scenarios.
