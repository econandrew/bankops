        - Nigeria
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      This assignment constitutes the opening phase of a process to improve the prospects for agribusiness in northern Nigeria. It aims to develop a clear understanding of the value chains in each of maize, rice, tomatoes, poultry and aquaculture as well as an understanding of the binding constraints to growth in those value chains.  It will focus on four states in Northern Nigeria: Jigawa, Katsina, Kano and Kaduna. 
      
      The core activity is to survey leading processors in each of the maize, rice, tomatoes, poultry and aquaculture value chains to understand the characteristics of the business involved such as their history, revenues, production, growth, and number of employees. It will also aim to establish a detailed understanding of the key constraints restricting further growth and job creation in these value chains and potential measures that could address those constraints.  The study is a qualitative research exercise to gain insight into the reality of the firm, learn the perspectives of interviewees, and discover the nuances in stories. A template for the survey will be provided and refined in conjunction with the Consultant.
      
      Core tasks for the Consultant will include 1) providing an initial brief overview of each value chain and a long list of firms operating in the value chain 2) identifying a sample of approximately 35 firms from this long list that will be interviewed across the five value chains and four states 3) conducting the interviews 4) writing detailed and structured profiles of the individual firms interviewed as well as sections synthesizing, for each value chain, the major constraints faced and firms views on potential measures to support business growth and job creation.
