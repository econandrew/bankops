      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The World Bank is preparing a regional disaster risk management and risk financing project for Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Myanmar. 
      This assignment is to develop a multi-country flood hazard and risk model for a quick response financing mechanism and pricing for market-based parametric financial instruments.  The model may utilize a combination of various data sources, such as historical flood and rainfall data, to underpin a rapid flood assessment methodology that triggers payouts when the event is more severe than a pre-defined threshold. The extent of an event that may trigger a payout should be measured by  real-time data sources, such as satellite-based rainfall data, satellite-based flood data, rainfall gauges and river discharge gauges. The severity of an event may be measured by the population or other exposure in the flood footprint. 
      As the model aims to inform rapid response financing, speed and precision of flood assessment are of crucial importance. The methodology needs to be sufficiently robust and objective to be acceptable to the clients and international insurance markets. The methodology should also be scalable across other countries in the region or beyond.
      Interested firms should provide an indication of the approach (or multiple options) they propose to undertake.
