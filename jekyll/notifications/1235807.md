      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1235807 - Global Inventory and Comparative Assessment of Drought Risk Modelling Tools
      
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The main objectives are to compile an inventory comprising quantitative and qualitative comparison of indicators, models, datasets and tools for specific applications related to the monitoring and assessment of drought hazard and risk. The results of this study should give clear guidance to development professionals regarding the best approaches and data sources to use to address a set of specific drought-related applications in developing countries.The applications are the following:
      1.	Detection and forecasting: detection and forecasting of drought circumstances on near-real time to seasonal (multi-month) time scales, using hydrological models and/or satellite observation.
      2.	Hazard mapping and hotspot identification: mapping of overall hazard levels for different metrics of drought hazard (rainfall deficit, water shortage, water scarcity, NDVI, WRSI, etc) reflecting the best estimate of current hazard under normal and extreme circumstances (i.e. various return periods), which are for example used in tools such as ThinkHazard! (www.thinkhazard.org). 
      3.	Risk assessment: the quantification of drought risk to the following impact categories: (1) population; (2) municipal and industrial water needs; (3) agricultural crop and livestock production; (4) hydropower production; and (5) the overall economy (e.g. GDP), on district, province, national and regional levels
      4.	Project stress testing: A set of representative events, i.e. a set of drought events typical for the region of interest, to use to stress test projects (e.g., new irrigation schemes or hydropower investments) or policies (e.g., drought-sensitive social protection systems). These representative events would also be used to assess the socioeconomic resilience of various countries, based on the methodology applied to other hazards in gfdrr.org/unbreakable.
      
      
      
      The assignment will have three components:
      1.	Data and model inventory: the production of an inventory of all relevant meteorological, hydrological and remote sensing indicators, models, datasets and tools (further referred to as Models) that can be used to detect and monitor drought risk in data scarce areas, for each of the three Applications described above. This inventory should result in a well-organized data inventory including spatial datasets on grid level as well as aggregated by Admin 1 and 2 levels, and a report detailing the various models and their possible applications and limitations.
      2.	Quantitative and qualitative comparison: A quantitative and qualitative comparative assessment of the pros and cons of the indicators identified in Component 1 in capturing drought impacts for the impact categories specified under Project Objectives ((1) population, (2) municipal and industrial areas, (3) agricultural crop and livestock production, (4) hydropower production, and (5) the overall economy (e.g. GDP)). This comparative assessment should include a spatial time-series analysis of each model, highlighting identified drought conditions over time; correlations with atmospheric patterns (e.g. annual seasonality, El Niño, La Niña); and correlation with reported drought conditions from independent sources. This analysis should be conducted for at least 5 low- and medium-income countries that are subject to diverse climatic and socioeconomic conditions. The 5 target countries should include Malawi and Ethiopia, and the other 3 countries are to be suggested by the Firm and agreed upon by GFDRR. The assessment should result in clear guidance on the technical performance of the various models as well as a clear guidance document for development professionals outlining the appropriate model to use for various drought-related purposes, specified under the objectives.
      3.	Representative event set development: The creation of a set of representative drought events (the number of events being determined by the analysis, but not to exceed 10) for all countries in the world, based on the findings under Component 2.  These events should reflect the typical drought type and severity in the target countries, and cover the range of possible socioeconomic impacts and frequency (from moderate but frequent drought to high-impact rare events). Also, different type of droughts have different sectoral impacts (e.g., some dry spells at the wrong season may affect annual crops without affecting hydropower while another droughts outside the growing season may have the opposite impact), and the set of events need to cover the different categories. The firm is to develop a methodology for producing representative events for all countries, resulting in (1) hazard maps, (2) impact maps and (3) a report describing the narrative and impact of the representative events. 
      
      
      Consistent with World Bank / GFDRR best-practice and the broader activity objectives, the data sets and model outputs will be shared with country governments and be made publicly accessible and usable through country or region GeoNodes.
