      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      Assignment Title: Tariff Study in the Electricity Sector in Mozambique
      Assignment Countries: Mozambique
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      Mozambique is a low income country with a population of almost 26 million where less than 1 every 4 persons enjoy electricity access. Electricidade de Mozambique (EdM) is making significant efforts to extend electricity access to all parts of the country, yet the World Bank has estimated that EdM will need to at least double current connection rate if the country aims to achieve universal access by 2030  in line with UNs Sustainable Energy for All program targets.
      At present EdM also has limited financial, technical and operational capacity to respond to the countrys ambitious goals for development of the power sector. The financial situation of the company is very weak, due to the lack of periodic tariff adjustments to ensure cost recovery.
      Achieving universal access will, therefore, require enormous efforts not only from the technical perspective but from the company as a whole, to ensure EdM operates in a sustainable business model which balances the social responsibility, commercial targets, operational efficiency and financial sustainability, including exports and challenges of the electricity supply industry.   
      The Government of Mozambique has requested support from the World Bank to review the existing pricing system for electricity services, identification of improvements needed to achieve financial viability of EDM and recommend approaches for implementation. 
      The objective of this study is to review the existing pricing system for electricity services, identification of improvements needed and recommend the tariff level, including adjustment mechanism to achieve financial viability and approaches for implementation.
