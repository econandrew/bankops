      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The Tenth Development Plan 201418 reaffirms the Turkish Governments commitment to increasing productivity and competitiveness of the Turkish economy. Boosting export competitiveness is an important component in meeting Turkey's aim towards a high-value added exports-driven economy and high growth rates.  Industry has been a significant driver for Turkeys economic progress in the past decade, the sector contributes 27 percent of value added (% GDP). Based on World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness analysis, Turkey is among efficiency-driven economies, striving to reach the next tier, innovation-driven economies. The national plan targets the expansion of industrial base through planned development of Organized Industrial Zones (OIZs). Operational OIZs in Turkey have mostly completed their factor-driven state by ensuring basic infrastructure and utilities, and moved into efficiency-driven state which now requires them to improve the quality of service they provide within OIZs and enhance their attractiveness for FDI. Green measures can help maximize efficiency potential of OIZs while targeting elevating resource consumption, waste generation and GHG emissions as a result of increased OIZ activities, while presenting a branding opportunity that improves competitiveness of the zone itself. The OIZs also develop important ties with the cities in which they operate and constitute and important part of sustainability at the city level through introducing green growth concepts.
