      Kenyan Counties have made considerable progress in implementing the provisions of the constitution and supportive legal framework but with varied success and significant challenges.  The successes that county governments have achieved need to be documented and a mechanism for knowledge sharing established. Counties further need support to mitigate the challenges they are facing in achieving effective citizen engagement.  The Council of Governors (CoG) would like to engage the services of a consultant to support CoG to assist counties in ensuring legal compliance to provisions on public participation, enhance the quality of county public participation mechanisms and support a mechanism for peer-to-peer learning on best practices.  The key tasks of the advisor will be to support the CoG on: (a) learning & knowledge exchange (b) capacity building; and (c) coordination support.
