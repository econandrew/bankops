      EGYPT- AIR AND WATER POLLUTION MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
      
      The works under this assignment focus on identification and assessment of key policy reforms and investment options to reduce air, water and land pollution. 
      
      In each of the key sectors which are the main contributors of air pollution in Greater Cairo and water pollution in the Nile Delta, an analysis will be undertaken to determine the key abatement and policy measures to adhere to good practice international standards. The key sectors of analysis are: (i) waste; (ii) agriculture: (iii) sanitation: (iv) energy; (vi) transport; and (vii) industry. Such measures can help to identify costs-efficient control and investment measures as well as policy measures aimed at stricter enforcement of control of pollutants or creating market mechanisms for their reduction. Given limitations in available data and duration of the assignment, standard emission factors to be used in the analysis, the results will be first order indications of costs and economic revenues of potential key interventions. This should be sufficient for establishing environmental and economic priorities, but will require further research before implementation of any such concrete measures.
