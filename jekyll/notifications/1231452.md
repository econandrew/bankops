      Background
      IFC CAF Services department is seeking to hire a short term consultant (STC) to support the Health and Education (H&E), and Tourism, Retail and Property (TRP) teams in market analysis and business development, mainly focusing on Nigeria and Ghana. 
      
      The primary responsibility of the STC will be to lead a detailed analysis of the sectors in these two countries, taking stock of the existing sector mapping exercises, and to help the teams identify key trends and opportunities for IFCs direct investments in these sectors. 
      
      Role
      1.	Research and analyze the private H&E and TRP sectors in Nigeria and Ghana. Research will include desktop research, discussion with IBRD/IFC staff, interviews with market participants (health and education providers as well as relevant experts e.g. industry associations, NGOs, consultants, banks etc) and meetings with prospects. This analysis will take stock of and build on IFCs existing work and knowhow in these markets.
      2.	Complete mapping exercises in these sectors in Nigeria and Ghana. 
      3.	Support the teams in processing transactions including conducting initial diligence, presenting opportunities to the investment committee for early approval, preparing and negotiating mandate letters, leading appraisal, preparing financial models, investment memos and board papers, managing the legal diligence and documentation and managing portfolio investments. 
      4.	In addition to these core responsibilities, the STC will provide ad hoc support as required to the investment team in other tasks related to business development and investment processing.
      
      The STC will be based in Lagos, Nigeria and will work closely with Zeynep Kantur Ozenci (H&E) and Andrei Tomilin (TRP). 
      
      The expected duration of the consultancy is 150 days.
      
      Deliverables
      Key deliverables will be:
      1.	A report on each market, covering market dynamics (size, growth, competitive landscape, regulation etc.), key players and the financing needs of the private sector (including current sources of finance and unmet needs). 
      2.	An excel spreadsheet listing key participants in each market (including an overview of their business and contact details) and identifying 5-10 companies in each market that have potential to become IFC clients
      3.	Organizing and participating in business development missions, accompanied by IFC staff, to meet with potential clients in each target market (dependent on assessment of market potential for IFC investment)

      2.	Four to five years experience in financial advisory, research and/or consulting.
