      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice provides policy advice and lending support to help client countries increase trade and investment, improve productivity and competitiveness at the national and industry levels, and create an inclusive, competitive private sector.  The T&C GP works with governments to identify policies that promote growth, while helping identify and remove impediments to the smooth functioning of markets. 
      
      The objective of this assignment is to research, design and finalize a survey tool to determine the key barriers faced by women in undertaking cross border trade.  Two sets of complimentary surveys are to be undertaken: one for women who run businesses that are involved in cross border trade; and the second for women customs brokers (or men in the absence of any female customs brokers). Together the two set of surveys should aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the barriers faced by women in conducting trade.
