      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank seeks the services of an economic advisory or development consulting firm for carrying out comprehensive midline surveys in rural areas of Punjab, India. These surveys will be used to accurately assess the impact of the community level sanitation interventions under Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin (SBM-G) on household sanitation behaviour in the beneficiary communities. More specifically, the evaluation seeks to answer the following questions: What is the effect of CLTS campaign on hygiene behavior? What is the effect of CLTS campaign on toilet construction and use? What is the effect of the interventions on health, education and satisfaction with quality of life? What is the effect of intensive school awareness programs (both primary and proposed mid-school awareness programs) on toilet use? What is the effect of intensive follow-up and vigilance post toilet construction on toilet use? What is the effect of availability of piped water connection to house on toilet use? What is the effect of variation in village level toilet coverage and usage on individual and community health (Sanitation externality)? In addition, the SaniFOAM framework will be used to identify factors supporting and working against achievement and sustainability of behavior change and drawing policy lessons for future implementation of sanitation program in Punjab
