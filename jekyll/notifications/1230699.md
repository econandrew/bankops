      Consultancy Services for Developing a Risk-based Road Infrastructure Asset Management System
      
      The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica (GoCD) has received grant funding from the Government of Italy through the World Bank to build the capacity of the Ministry of Public Works and Ports (MoPWP) and put in place appropriate infrastructure management tools, following damages caused by Tropical Storm Erika, which occurred on August 27. 2015, and intends to apply part of the proceeds of this grant to payments under the contract for provision of consultancy services for setting up a computerized risk-based road infrastructure Asset Management System (AMS) in the MoPWP.
      
      The objective of the Consultancy assignment is to implement a sustainable computerized risk-based AMS that will support effective decision making in prioritizing road infrastructure investment options at strategic, tactical and operations levels of asset management. The scope of the consultancy services shall include but not be limited to the following:
      
      -Implementing a AMS that is user friendly and tailored to the needs of the GoCD and other stakeholders, incorporates a central database with a Geographical Information System (GIS) interface for storage and management of asset data and provides decision making functions for prioritizing investment needs based on multi-objective criteria such as asset criticality, vulnerability to landslide and flood risks, budgets and cost benefit analysis amongst others. The system should be an adaptation of an existing AMS, using open source applications or components as much as is practicable.
      
      -In addition to standard pavement and structure management, the AMS will need to incorporate landslide and flood risks to roads and bridges using a well-established methodology.
      
      -Collecting (i) standard pavement and structural conditions, and (ii) landslide and flood hazard/vulnerability data along 321 kms of primary roads, 74 kms of secondary roads, 158 kms of urban roads and 338 kms of feeder roads.
      
      -Testing the AMS with the data collected on GoCD roads and bridges.
      
      -Developing a plan and/or procedures for the MoPWP for data collection and using the AMS for prioritizing road asset investment options at network, program, and project levels and for project monitoring and evaluation.
      
      -Developing a 5-year road infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance investment plan using the collected data and the AMS.
      
      -Transferring and embedding knowledge to MoPWP through close working collaboration, ensuring counterpart staff are actively involved in all key activities including data collection and analysis, as well as system implementation amongst others.
      
      The consultancy contract period is expected to be about 10 months.
