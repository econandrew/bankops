      As part of its ongoing technical assistance activities in support of Albania, IFC is looking to hire a specialized consultant with (i) experience in designing the regulatory framework and infrastructure required to establish a competitive electricity market, and (ii) experience in similar assignments in the Balkan (South Eastern Europe) region. 
      
      Creating a day-ahead market will be the natural starting point for liberalizing the power market and this will boost liquidity and efficiency in pricing, while also allowing for a smooth integration with neighboring countries through a market coupling.
