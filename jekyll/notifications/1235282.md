      Background
      
      In recent years, a number of countries have experimented with various implementation modalities to correct market and governance failures within and across industries. They include economic zones, growth poles, global value chain development, city-level competitiveness strategies, and innovation systems, among others.  Each of these modalities integrates and sequences basic elements of private sector development: regulatory and business environment reforms, public investment in basic and industrial infrastructure, as well as skills development, institutional strengthening of public agencies and cluster institutions, and catalytic mechanisms to enhance access to finance for private firms.
      
      At the heart of these efforts is a new growth paradigm that seeks to motivate collective action by public and private actors at the industry level, and to forge linkages to the larger domestic economy through cross-sectoral and spatially-targeted efforts.  Their innovative aspects lie in the ability to bundle and deliver support to industries; to coordinate macro, mezzo, and micro-level reforms; and to convene public and private sector actors.  Increased private sector investment, greater entry of new firms, and higher productivity in select industries will result in positive spillovers to the broader economy and significant sustainable job growth. 
      At the same time, such approaches can be complex and challenging to implement.  The associated risks can be managed through programmatic design, prioritization of activities (for example, through sector sequencing), use of recursive approaches in the design and implementation based on extensive public-private dialogue, and reliance on third party monitoring and short feedback loops.
      
      Given the volume of data required to design and the risks to manage during implementation, such interventions require a considerable amount of resources during their design and implementation. To address this situation, in 2012-2013, the World Bank, the European Union (EU), the African, Caribbean, Pacific Group of States Secretariat (ACP), and the governments of Austria, Switzerland and Norway, set up a multi-donor trust fund partnership under the umbrella of the Competitive Industries and Innovation Program (CIIP), managed by the World Bank.
      
      The purpose of the CIIP is to enhance country growth and employment prospects by supporting public policies and investments that promote competitiveness and innovation within and across industries.  In doing so, CIIP has developed two windows of financing, one for knowledge and one for country-level operations financed by donors (including the World Bank).  The knowledge window is aimed at applied research that can be directly used to inform the design and implementation mechanisms of country operations supporting competitiveness and innovation. The country operation window seeks to support development projects with the specific objective of creating jobs, increasing firm level productivity and innovation, and doing so with positive social spillovers.
      
      CIIP aims to support and catalyze reforms to specific sectors to help drive innovation and competitiveness improvements. This in turn contributes to a set of tangible outcomes. Specifically, CIIP is focused on achieving concrete impacts on: 
      	growth in private investment and productivity;
      	creation and growth of new firms; 
      	job creation and income generation.
      
      Objectives
      
      The main purpose of this midterm review is to undertake an independent and objective assessment of the programs design and structure, as well as progress on implementation and achievements to date, in order to draw out key lessons and to recommend improvements in the implementation processes and management. Some of the questions that the review will address include: is the program relevant as an instrument of the new growth paradigm and new industrial policy but also in terms of geography (MICs, LICs and Fragile Economies). Is there value addition? Is the design effective? Is the CIIP structure working in the client countries? Is the grant proposal mechanism working well in terms of donor support vs WBG resources? Is implementation effective? And where else can the program improve?
      The specific objectives of the review are;
      1.	To establish if the CIIP is on track to deliver against the programs results framework indicators (outputs and outcomes) by the target date of 2019.
      2.	To assess the strength of the design and proposal process and make recommendations for refinement. 
      3.	To assess the extent to which the CIIP is supporting: 
      	Diagnostic and analytical work;
      	Technical, market-based analytics and assessments to identify opportunities and market failures;
      	Development of stable and effective public-private dialogue mechanisms;
      	Design of a reform program tackling key constraints (such as policy and regulatory concerns, access to finance, skills and technology transfer, infrastructure, and institution-building);
      	Financing instruments and mechanisms to support a reform agenda;
      	Definition of impact targets along with measurement and evaluation.
      4.	To assess the CIIPs governance and management structures, including monitoring, reporting to donors and financial management of the trust fund.
      5.	To make recommendations for any adjustments in the program, as required, and to present a corresponding action matrix.
      
      Scope of Activities
      
      The Review will cover activities, outputs and outcomes of the CIIP beginning with development of the initial work programs. It will broadly follow the OECDs Development Assistance Committees criteria for Evaluating Development Assistance, namely in terms of assessing the trust funds design, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, sustainability, and visibility in terms of developing competitiveness industry innovation policies, and exit strategy. 
      The work will cover five areas:
      
      i)	Design Assessment
      ii)	Relevance of the program 
      iii)	Effectiveness of the trust fund
      iv)	Efficiency of fund use
      v)	Impact and overview of results
      
      Detailed Terms of Reference explaining the complete scope of work, objectives and scope of activities is attached.
