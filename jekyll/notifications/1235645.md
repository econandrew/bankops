      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank is currently implementing the second phase of the Niger Safety Nets Program providing cash transfers and accompanying measures. A rigorous large scale randomized study on targeting methods has been incorporated as an integral part of the project. At the same time, productive accompanying measures will be piloted to test the extent to which they can promote more productive livelihood and resilience among poor households. As part of the targeting study, a baseline survey was implemented in 2015 and a midline survey in 2016. A baseline survey is now planned for the Livelihood and Resilience Experiment. It will take place in the same geographical location as the targeting study baseline and midline surveys. The World Bank is seeking a firm to contact the selected households (approximately 5000) and administer face-to-face interviews to different members of these households. The survey is planned for March/April 2016. (A long-term follow-up survey would take place in 2018.)
      
      Detailed Terms of Reference will be provided to shortlisted firms at the RFP stage.
