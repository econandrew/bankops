      I) Background  
      The National Student Assessment (NSA) 2011 was the first robust learning assessment conducted in Bangladesh at grade 3 and grade 5 level in Bangla and Mathematics. It was implemented in December 2011, involving 17, 615 students in grade 3 and 13,854 students in grade 5 in 726 schools nationwide. This is a nationally representative sample of grade 3 and grade 5 students, with representations of both Government Primary Schools (GPS) and Registered Non-Government Primary Schools (RNGPS). In 2013 and 2015, the NSA was extended in scope to cover 7 different types of schools, which were: GPS, NNGPS/RNGPS, High School attached primary schools, Kindergarten, Madrasahs, BRAC centers and ROSC centers. In 2015, NSA was implemented in these seven types of schools and included 23,040 students in grade 3 and 19406 students in grade 5 from 1,175 schools.
      The NSA 2011, 2013 and NSA 2015 assessed the learning achievement of the aforementioned pupils relative to the learning outcomes prescribed in the primary curriculum. Other objectives were: to investigate differences in pupil achievement by key system, school and pupil factors {e.g., division, district, school type, locality (urban v. rural), and gender}; to examine the relationships between achievement and factors such as school size, class size, pupil-teacher ratio, attendance rate, teachers' qualifications and training, training of school managers, and frequency of inspection; and to draw implications for improvements in teaching and learning through enhanced policy actions, planning and management, and teacher education.  It is expected that relevant Government of Bangladesh (GoB) line agencies will utilize the findings and recommendations in order to inform educational planning of sub-components such as teacher professional development and curriculum reform.
      The DPE counterpart for managing this consultancy is the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Division. The technical counterparts are the National Assessment Cell (NAC), DPE (officers responsible for conducting the NSA), and the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB), responsible for developing, piloting and finalizing test items in collaboration with the National Academy for Primary Education (NAPE), under the guidance of the international Consultants.  
       
      II) Objectives for the Consultancy  
      The firm is expected to -  
      (i)	Provide hands-on support at every stage of the process.  
      (ii)	Ensure quality of test items, sampling methodology, administration manuals, marking and scoring guide, analysis and dissemination, etc.  
      (iii)	Build the capacity of the NAC team of M&E, DPE in undertaking more technical activities related to the 4th NSA of Grades 3 and 5 planned under PEDP3 in 2017.  
      (iv)	Integrate Setting Performance Standard methods to enhance the usefulness of NSA 2017.
      Technical assistance will be required at each stage of developing, analyzing and finalizing test items, setting performance standards, and analyzing results. This technical assistance will help DPE to monitor the progress in student learning since the NSA baseline in 2011 by developing standard test items. The curriculum reform was done for Grades 1-12 in 2012 (and implemented from 2013). The test items developed and used for 2017 will allow effective monitoring of students' performance over time, in comparison with 2011, 2013 and 2015.  
      It is also important that the test items depart from textbook-based to competency based. So, that the Test items for NSA 2017 should not be textbook-based.  It is essential to develop a new set of test items that measures competency of the curriculum objectives while maintaining the comparability with NSA 2011, NSA 2013 and NSA 2015 so that progress is properly tracked.  
      This assignment will also establish a learning trajectory by linking National Student Assessment (NSA) 2017 and Learning Assessment of Secondary Institutions (LASI) 2017 which are taken place around the same time. The consultant specified under the NAC of DPE assignment will have a primary responsibility of coordinating with the consultant for LASI under the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) .
