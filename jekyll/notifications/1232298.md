      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The main objective of this consultancy will be to identify and codify the Japan experience in moving up the waste management chain in Japan, and what are the preconditions required for that, including legal, regulatory, institutional and financial environment (i.e. the Japanese roadmap).
      
      Background
      Over the last three decades, waste management in the European Union (EU) has evolved from a focus on disposal to prevention and recycling. Moving municipal waste management up the 'waste hierarchy' (i.e. waste prevention, reuse, recycling, recovery and disposal) required changes to the legal and regulatory environment of EU states. Additionally, the introduction of economic incentives made disposal of untreated waste less attractive, expensive, and practically impossible. Today, landfilling of untreated waste is virtually prohibited in several EU countries while other countries need to meet increasing targets. The permitting for new landfill development is purposely difficult. Economic incentives in support of the waste hierarchy range from the introduction of landfill tax that increases the cost of disposal, to green tariff for waste derived products, fiscal relief and so forth. As a result, in the past fifteen years, there has been a steady decrease in landfilling, increase in recycling and an increase, though less profound, in incineration . The combination of regulatory instruments and economic incentives has also caused a spike in research and development, and investments in new and more efficient treatment technologies. 
      
      The World Bank is currently working in the field of solid waste management (SWM) with a large number of middle-income countries in Europe and Central Asia (the former Soviet bloc). Virtually all of these countries endeavor to follow and replicate the waste management practices found in the EU and other industrial countries with leading practices in SWM as Japan or Korea. Countries that have recently joined the EU (i.e. the new member states) or are in a process of accession (i.e. pre-accession or candidate countries) are required to meet increasing targets, transpose the Acquis communautaire   and eventually, over time, become fully compliant with the EU waste related directives and regulations. These countries have access to significant accession funds from the EU, know-how and technical assistance. Significant progress can be observed in for instance Poland, Romania and Bulgaria. Among the countries not on an EU accession path, the vast majority has also chosen to adopt the waste hierarchy principle, among others, and seek to replicate experiences and approaches from the high-income OECD world. Concurrently, these countries lack the right set of conditions required to support their ambition towards a circular economy. In fact, in many of them, the SWM sector is quite basic, disposal may not be environmentally sustainable, and the sectors legal, regulatory and institutional environment is weak or underdeveloped. At the same time, misconceptions about the sector persist, such as that more equipment will solve most of the problems, that the sector is quite profitable and could therefore be left to the private sector to handle on its own. In addition, many governments are unwilling to raise tariffs which remain significantly below cost but wish to embark on expensive investments in treatment technologies (and in some cases have done so). The environmental and sector awareness of the public is extremely low.
      
      While some industrialized countries are successful in reducing the quantities of municipal solid waste that are generated and landfilled (e.g. EU member states, Japan) by moving up in the waste hierarchy, other countries are facing difficulties despite that substantial investments are being made (i.e. countries from the former Soviet bloc). By comparing the implementation conditions - financial, institutional, legal, waste generators participation, operations - lessons can be learned benefiting policy makers, development partners and operators.
      
      The Japan case in SWM is particularly appealing and could serve as a positive example for other countries. The sector in Japan has reached a high level of sophistication and uses some of the most advanced technologies world-wide. The World Bank is now looking for a consultant who can identify and codify knowledge around how Japanese cities moved up the value chain in SWM. This should include a comprehensive analysis of the sectors enabling environment, including legal, regulatory, institutional and financial environment. 
      
      Objective and Target Audience
      
      The main objective of the study will be to develop a roadmap on SWM outlining the preconditions for success and providing practical development approaches to responsibly move up the chain of the waste hierarchy and upgrade existing waste management systems. 
      
      The roadmap will be supported by case studies and will be based on experience from developed OECD countries. In particular, in will present positive examples from the EU and Japan as well as a few case studies from middle-income countries in Europe/Central Asia demonstrating the limitations of a piece-meal approach (e.g.  Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Hercegovina). The case studies will seek to demonstrate that advances in the SWM sector need to be gradual and follow a phased approach that is comprehensive. The examples will address legal, regulatory, institutional, technical, economic, financial and public awareness/social contract aspects. In addition, the case studies will demonstrate that the development of a sustainable municipal SWM system will principally depend on the availability of financing, in addition to informed public awareness and education, enforcement and a strong commitment by the public sector. The roadmap will then include development approaches on how and where to start upgrading the MSW sector, what examples to follow, how to organize, how to deal with obstacles faced by local governments, such as lack of funding, lack of planning and operational capacity, lack of awareness and so on. 
      
      The main target audience will be municipal councils, mayors, municipalities, utilities and potential investors in SWM in developing countries. Additionally, practitioners, SWM Associations, central policy line ministries, donors, environmental NGOs active in SWM, and sector stakeholders will also benefit from the research conducted and generated.
