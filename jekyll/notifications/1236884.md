      The purpose of the PPCR Learning Partner is to create and facilitate a dynamic, actively-engaged knowledge and learning network amongst the PPCR community of practitioners  including recipient countries, MDBs and other stakeholders  that generates and shares practical, evidence-based learning to advance climate resilience goals both in the PPCR and globally.  The Learning Partner will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and lessons learned among PPCR pilot countries, MDBs, and other stakeholders based on their engagement at a global meeting of PPCR recipient countries (known as the PPCR Pilot Country Meeting) as well as through an online forum and potentially one regional learning exchange.  The Learning Partner will also conduct small-scale evaluative and analytical work to rapidly respond to learning needs within the network, and leverage the sharing of existing evaluative and analytical work developed by PPCR entities both within the network and externally with relevant global networks.   Overall, the Learning Partner is expected to assist the PPCR and E&L teams to identify and pilot effective mechanisms and approaches for the network of PPCR practitioners to implement and sustain ongoing knowledge exchange through evidence-based learning.  
      
      The initial scope of work will be a pilot of approximately 6-8 months, through approximately November 2017.  More details are in the attached draft Terms of Reference; please note this ToR will be further revised before the RFP stage and may entail significant changes.
