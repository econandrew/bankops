      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The specific objective of this project will be to i) conduct a landscape mapping of the impact investment ecosystem in health and education, ii) propose potential products and vehicles that would enable IFC to address the current gaps and mobilize financing through an impact investing platform, and iii) identify opportunities for IFC to play a catalytic role in the impact investing field for H&E enterprises. 
      
      The end goal of the study is to inform IFC about potential successful private investment models that can address the financing challenges that private H&E enterprises face. 
      
      This is intended to enable IFC to consider how to mobilize a diversified set of investors or grant funders to provide patient capital, blended finance products, advisory support, capacity building and other services to a wide range of investment opportunities that serve the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) and would not otherwise happen due to prevailing market return expectations.
