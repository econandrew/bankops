      The Government of India has prioritized rural sanitation under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Clean India Campaign with a prime objective of making India Open Defecation Free (ODF) by 2019. To support achievement of SBM Grameen (rural) goals, the World Bank provides a USD 1.5 billion loan to the Government of India. In addition, a Technical Assistance (TA) program has been initiated, to strengthen SBM (G) program delivery institutions at the national level, and in select states with high number of people practicing open defecation such as Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Haryana.
      
      Concurrent assessments of SBM (G) have identified an urgent need of strengthening training capacity in the states to develop sufficient human resource capacity at the district and block levels to design and implement successful district-wide ODF campaigns, which covers a range of issues including community planning, behavior change communication and technology options. 
      
      Therefore World Bank Group plans to engage a consultant firm or consortium of firms to develop technical training capacity in the area of facilitating ODF campaign in select states. The selection of states will be based on demand from the states where the Bank has existing engagements on rural sanitation.
