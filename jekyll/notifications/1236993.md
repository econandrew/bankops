      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1236993 - CONSULTING FIRM TO PERFORM GEOSPATIAL MAPPING OF OFF-GRID COMMUNITIES IN SINDH AND PUNJAB, PAKISTAN.
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Pakistan
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      This assignment is for a consulting firm. Building upon demonstrated approaches through other World Bank Group engagements to reliably detect electrified and un-electrified communities, the consulting firm will use geospatial methods to analyze a lengthy time series of nighttime satellite images to detect the presence or absence of outdoor lighting in rural communities across Sindh and Punjab Provinces of Pakistan.
      
      More specifically, this assignment will include but not limit itself to the following tasks:
      
      Phase 1:
      -	Identify and assess the data and information needs from IFC Lighting Pakistan associates, as well as confirm that both the proposed output of the analysis and its format adequately respond to needs. This will be achieved through at least 2 (virtual) consultations with private sector stakeholders facilitated by the IFC team.
      -	Acquire, validate and analyze variety of administrative and geographical data including GIS locations of villages/settlements, socio-demographic data and other relevant data. As a part of this, Lighting Pakistan in collaboration with the consultant, will also look into the possibility of working with Distribution Companies in Sindh and Punjab on this project, for collection of data and for matching the results later on.
      -	Conduct a results validation exercise using available data for the two districts to assess the validity of the methodology and subsequent results. The results of this assessment together with potential error margins and other variations will be described in the report.
      -	Publish the algorithm and associated code developed as part of this assignment 
      -	Present and gather feedback from IFC Lighting Pakistan associates on the results of the analysis towards informing further the development of phase 2.
      
      Phase 2: 
      In phase two, the consultant will then undertake detailed geospatial mapping and satellite data analysis on data collected and validated during phase one, and expand the work done in the pilot. Based on this analysis the consultant shall prepare the following outputs:
      -	Report for Punjab and Sindh (i) presenting the data detailing approach method and key results; (ii) comparing and contrasting patterns of rural electrification depicted in administrative data against changes in satellite detected light output detailed in tables and descriptive analysis; (iii) including detailed data tables identifying all off-grid villages that lack access to the grid or experiences significant levels of load shedding estimated by satellite imagery; 
      -	Underlying datasets in electronic format notably GIS layers for both the input datasets and the analysis output. The format of the datasets would allow to be used in Google Earth among other GIS software, as well as a dynamic exploration of areas with the greatest concentration of un-electrified communities.
      -	Publication of analysis code and algorithm on an open source basis on the WBG Energy Sector GitHub account 
      The analysis will begin with coverage for Sindh provide east of the 68th meridian for which population data has already been acquired by IFC. Then this approach will be extended to Punjab. The consultant will work closely with the IFC Lighting Pakistan team to match findings of the study with the situation on the ground.
