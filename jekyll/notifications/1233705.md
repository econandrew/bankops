      1.	Objectives of the Assignment
      The objective of this assignment is to develop and deliver a detailed, tiered and practical training course for city engineers, solid waste system managers, equipment operators and other key staff involved directly in managing, operating and maintaining all aspects of city solid waste management systems. This course will provide both foundational classroom (as needed) and detailed hands-on training including all of the elements in the Landfill Operating and Management Plans (LOMPs) to be prepared under a separate contract. The training course will address common elements found in the LOMPs as well as all aspects of solid waste collection, transportation and material recovery. At the conclusion of the course, participants will have gained the key competencies needed to successfully operate and maintain the existing landfill sites and the solid waste collection, transportation and material recovery systems. 
      
      2.	Scope
      There are four components to the assignment:
      i.	Training Needs Analysis and Curriculum Development
      
      The first component is a training needs analysis of the technical capacity of solid waste staff and management to sustainably operate and maintain all aspects of the collection, transportation, material recovery and disposal operations. The needs analysis will evaluate the knowledge and skills required for solid waste system management, operations and maintenance against the formal and informal education of city personnel as well as their in-service training. It should be noted that solid waste management staff have received some foundational training from the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MUDHo) and other Federal Ministries. 
      
      The curriculum should be consistent with standards, guidelines or other requirements for solid waste collection, transportation, material recovery and landfilling as specified under the Solid Waste Management Proclamation as well as the National Urban Solid Waste Standards, 2014 and the Solid Waste Management Manual, 2012 prepared by the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing (MUDHo). Where guidance is not available under GoE legislation, manuals and guidelines, the consultant shall align the curriculum, to the extent practical, to basic international best practices.
      
      On the basis of the training needs analysis, the consultancy will develop a detailed training curriculum that, at a minimum, includes the following:
      
      Required competencies for solid waste operational managers, equipment operators and other key staff
      Training objectives for each staff position
      Training topics with descriptions
      Training methods / media
      Course materials
      Schedule / agenda
      
      At the conclusion of the training, the consultancy will conduct a proficiency assessment to determine the effectiveness of the training program and the ability of staff to undertake the prescribed functions. A course certificate will be issued to each participant achieving the required level of proficiency.
      
      As part of the needs analysis, the consultancy will initially identify staffing gaps in one or two representative cities (as selected by MUDHo) to undertake the functions needed to sustainably operate and maintain the solid waste management systems.  A separate staffing gaps report will be prepared and submitted as an initial output by the consultancy for consideration and follow-up by city managers and the MUDHo.
      
      ii.	Practical Classroom and Field Training
      
      The second component will require the consultant to provide practical classroom and hands-on training based on the staff training curriculum. Training will be tiered recognizing the different competencies required for management and specific staff positions and training that has been provided to date. 
      
      Foundational training (as required) covering a broad range of topics from solid waste system design, operations, maintenance, staffing, monitoring, contingency planning to landfill site closure. The objective of the foundational learnings is to build, as required, an understanding of the theory and critical elements of solid waste management for city engineers, site managers and operational staff. It is anticipated that this element will last for one and a half (1.5) days.
      
      Detailed hands-on classroom training covering all of the elements in the curriculum. Classroom sessions will use a variety of methods and media including practical demonstrations, videos and Skype sessions with solid waste system operators in other jurisdictions to maximize staff participation, interest and learning. This element will cover the complete value chain of the solid waste management system with a focus on overall system optimization as well as opportunities to promote waste reduction, recycling and composting as methods to both reduce the quantities of waste requiring landfilling and also to generate revenue. Opportunities to promote the use of MSEs to undertake waste reduction, recycling and composting will be identified. The objective of this element is to build the competence of solid waste system managers and operating staff to operate and maintain their solid waste systems. It is anticipated that this element will last for three (3.0) days.
      
      iii.	Landfill Start-up Support
      
      The third component will require the consultant to provide start-up support and hands-on training for solid waste landfill managers and operational personnel based on the staff training curriculum and the individual Landfill Operating and Management Plans (LOMPs) now being developed under a separate contract. To undertake this element, the consultant will work with one of the secondary cities (yet to be chosen by MUDHo) to open and begin operations at one of the existing landfill sites. The objective would be to provide hands on experience based on the curriculum to landfill managers, supervisors and equipment operators from up to eight secondary cities to be selected by MUDHo. It is anticipated that this direct work experience would last for five (5) days.
      
      iv.	Ongoing Operational Support
      The fourth component will require the consultancy to provide as needed technical assistance to each of the cities as operations get underway. This technical assistance could take the form of telephone calls, emails, Skype sessions, webinars and a workshop to address problems identified locally. 
      
      
      3.Tasks
      The Consultancy is expected to undertake the following broadly defined tasks and produce the related outputs. It should be noted that MUDHo and the World Bank may decide not to proceed with individual elements under iii) Start-up Support or iv) Ongoing Operational Support at their sole discretion.
      At the end of the Inception Phase of the assignment, an Inception Workshop will be held with MUDHo, selected cities and the World Bank to refine the scope and content of the assignment and to develop a clear work plan for completion of the project within the defined timelines.
      
      Task 1 Training Needs Analysis
      
      This task requires that the consultant conduct a training needs analysis of staff in one or two of the cities as selected by MUDHo. The needs analysis will evaluate the knowledge and skills required for solid waste system management, operations and maintenance against the formal and informal education of city personnel as well as in-service training provided to date by MUDHo or other Federal Ministries.
      
      As an initial step, the consultant will identify staffing gaps to undertake the functions needed to sustainably operate and maintain the solid waste system.  A separate staffing gaps report will be prepared and submitted as an initial output by the consultant for consideration and follow-up by the city managers and MUDHo.
      
      The training needs analysis will be presented at a workshop attended by selected cities, MUDHo and the World Bank. Changes will be made to the documents based on input from the participants.
      
      Outputs: Staffing gaps report and training needs analysis according to the delivery timelines
      
      Task 2    Curriculum and Materials Development 
      
      Task 2 requires that the consultant develop a curriculum and the training materials to be delivered at the training sessions in Tasks 3 and 4 to meet the requirements prescribed in the needs analysis. The curriculum will address required staff competencies, training objectives, training topics, training methods / media, course materials and the training schedule. Materials will include a training binder with CD as a reference. Classroom sessions will use a variety of methods and media including practical demonstrations, videos and Skype sessions with solid waste system operators in other jurisdictions to maximize staff participation, interest and learning. 
      
      The draft curriculum will be presented at a meeting with MUDHo and the World Bank. Changes will be made to the documents based on input from the participants.
      
      Output:Draft curriculum and training materials according to the delivery timelines.
      
      Task 3 Practical Classroom and Hands-on Training
      
      Foundational and detailed hands-on classroom training will be provided as prescribed in the curriculum. It is anticipated that this combined training will take place over a total four and a half (4.5) days.
      
      It is anticipated that for the foundation (as required) and detailed classroom training there will be approximately (# to be determined) participants from the cities.
      
      Output:Training sessions provided according to the delivery timelines
      
      Task 4 Landfill Start-up Support 
      
      Start-up support and training will be provided as prescribed in the curriculum. It will be comprised of start-up support training at one of the existing landfill sites.
