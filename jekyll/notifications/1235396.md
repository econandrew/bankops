      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank Groups (WBG) Rwanda Investment Climate Reform aims to support the Government of Rwanda's (GoR) economic development agenda. The program will focus on addressing key constraints to increasing private investment in the GoRs priority sectors notably in tourism sector.
      
      Although Rwanda is experiencing healthy growth in both arrivals and tourism investment, a significant acceleration in growth is required to meet the GoRs revenue target in 2017. The WBG has identified two key constraints to accelerated growth, namely;
      - the lack of a tourism regulatory body and an unclear, inconsistent regulatory framework, and 
      - the concentration of tourism activities in just two areas, Kigali and Virunga.
      
      The WBG is supporting Rwanda Development Board to remove these constraints in order to stimulate private investment and job creation.  The service of a consulting firm to undertake a comprehensive exercise in positioning and master planning the Kibuye area.
