      Short Term Consultant  Gender and Energy Expert
      Efficient, Clean Cooking and Heating
      
      
      Background
      
      Worldwide, three billion people rely on solid fuels, such as wood or coal, for cooking and heating, which results in severe health, environmental and climate impacts. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), household air pollution from cooking kills over 4 million people every year more than the number of deaths from malaria and tuberculosis combined and sickens millions more from lung and heart diseases. Women and children are disproportionally affected by health impacts, and bear much of the burden of cooking and collecting firewood or other traditional fuels. Women can play a key role in catalyzing the efficient clean cooking and heating (ECCH) market for fuels and stoves by influencing the design and uptake of products and engaging in income-generating opportunities along the value chain. 
      
      To address this global issue and increase access to ECCH solutions on a large scale, investment needs are estimated to be at least US$4.4 billion annually.  As a response to the need to scale up global efforts, ESMAP launched the Efficient, Clean Cooking and Heating initiative in 2015. It has the objective of providing technical assistance to client countries, supporting policy and regulatory reforms, and mobilizing finance to scale up access to clean and efficient cooking and heating solutions. The ECCH program is co-led by a cross-sectoral team from energy, climate, health and gender at the World Bank Group (WBG). 
      
      Objective of the Assignment 
      
      Under the ECCH work is ongoing which is specifically focused on understanding what the gender-specific impacts and opportunities of clean cooking and heating are and how these can be monitored and measured at the project level. Additional support is needed on the gender aspects of the ECCH engagements across various key tasks that are outlined below.
      	Lead gender assessment of the ECCH projects in the WBG portfolio through a desk level assessment and Task-Team Leader (TTL) interviews (60%): Review pipeline, active and closed ECCH operations to assess the gender-specific impacts and opportunities of clean cooking. Conduct desk-level review of key documents (Project Appraisal Documents and Implementation Status and Results etc.) and lead TTL interviews to assess what projects have delivered on gender in terms of consultation, governance and decision making, job creation, innovative consumer interface, marketing and economic empowerment. In addition, the consultant will be expected to briefly collate and summarize the best-practice interventions on gender and ECCH beyond the WBG. Overall findings to be captured in a brief note featuring case studies to illustrate best practice. 
      1.	Advisory and operational support on gender in pipeline and ongoing operations under ECCH (25%): Establish and maintain a screening system for ECCH projects to ensure all projects are reviewed for gender considerations and potential support this include existing and pipeline lending operations and TA work. This should build on the gender assessment of the portfolio and target a few key operations across regions that could take-up gender approaches in e.g. decision making, job creation and economic empowerment. 
      2.	Results and monitoring & evaluation (10%): Contribute to the ongoing engagement on the gender methodology discussion under ECCH. For example, provide technical input on gender-specific impacts of ECCH related to project design, working group consultations and meetings with stakeholders.
      3.
