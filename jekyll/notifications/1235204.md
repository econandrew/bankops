      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1235204 - Assessment of COMESA Frameworks for Anti-Cartel Enforcement
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Trade & Competitiveness (T&C) Competition Policy Team of the World Bank Group (WBG) advises client countries on how to improve their investment climate for domestic and foreign investors. The Competition Team caters to both policy and project related advisory work on promotion of competition and effective implementation of competition policy at the economy and sectoral level. The Competition Team helps client governments to assess constraints that impede the development of competitive market structures in key strategic sectors, design the legal and institutional framework for an effective competition policy in emerging markets, and mainstream the principles of competition policy within broader investment climate reforms.
      
      As part of a program of support to strengthen anticartel enforcement in the region, and in line with COMESA Competition Commission (CCC) strategic priorities, the WBG intends to hire a firm to conduct an assessment of CCC and National Competition Agencies/Authorities legal frameworks for anticartel enforcement.
      
      This information will be important to identify and highlight:
      - Areas of concurrency or overlap in CCC and COMESA NCA legal and regulatory frameworks for anticartel enforcement that could be leveraged to strengthen anticartel enforcement actions in the COMESA region; and
      - Gaps or contradictions in the framework that could weaken anticartel enforcement actions in the COMESA region.

      This assignment requires a consulting firm with experience in carrying out assessments of competition legal, policy and regulatory frameworks particularly in anticartel enforcement, assessment and analysis of competition issues in a regional context; exposure to Africa and emerging economies, and experience providing policy advice to governments and regional economic communities.
