      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

      Rapid Assessment of Swachh Bharat Mission Gramin (SBM (G)  rural clean India mission  implementation and Identify, Validate and Document Good Practices.

      India 
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) 2nd October 2014. The SBM has two Sub-Missions, the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin/rural) and the Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban). The goal is to achieve Swachh Bharat by the symbolic date of 2nd October 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. In rural sanitation there have been three successive centrally sponsored rural sanitation programs since 1986. Compared with its predecessors, the implementation approach of the SBM (G) is distinguished by: 
      	High visibility mass communication campaign and call to citizens from all walks of life to join in a peoples movement for Clean India  
      	Emphasis on collective behavior change and not just toilet construction 
      	Focus on district as a unit of implementation with variation in approaches within and across States   
      	Time-bound, with a stronger results-orientation focusing on outcome monitoring and not just inputs and outputs 
      
      The SBM (G) has entered into its third year of implementation. Given the diversity and expanse of India, it is inevitable that variations exist across States and Districts in approaches and implementation models to address the challenge of open defecation. While there is a long way to go to achieve and sustain an open defecation free (ODF) rural India, many success stories and innovations have emerged across the country. 
      
      As a part of the Bank-Executed Technical Assistance to the SBM (G), the World Bank would now like to engage a firm to undertake documentation of good practice case studies concurrently with regular qualitative assessment of SBM (G) implementation. This activity will have the following components: 
      
      1.	Provide a 6-monthly representative  covering not less than eight states  qualitative assessment of SBM (G) implementation practices at national, state, district, and Gram Panchayat levels. In total, 4 rounds of rapid assessments will be undertaken over a period of 2 years at approximately 6 month intervals.
      2.	Provide in-depth assessment of a select number of key issues using quantitative research methods.  Data will be preferably collected using mobile devices. Per assessment round, an average of 2 in-depth follow-up studies will be undertaken. 
      3.	On the basis of the rapid assessment and in consultation with the WB-team, identify, validate, and document good practice related to SBM (G).  An estimated 20 good practices be studied on an annual basis.
      4.	Prepare bi-monthly fact sheets on the status of SBM (G) at national level and for select (3 to 5) states.
      5.	Support the dissemination of the assessment findings and the documented good practices through high-quality and appropriate communication material targeting a range of district, state, national, and international audiences
      
      The first round of rapid assessment is expected to be completed by June 2017. 
      
      Qualification Criteria
