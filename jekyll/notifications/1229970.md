      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1229970 - Zambia - National Multi-Tier framework Energy Access Household Energy Survey
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Zambia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      
      The World Bank-ESMAP team with the Ministry of Energy (MoE), the Rural Electrification Authority (REA), ZESCO LIMITED (ZESCO) and the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is launching the first Global Energy Access Household Surveys in access deficit countries so as to set a baseline to track progress towards Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) goal and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 7 on access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy by 2030. 
      Access to electricity in Zambia has increased from 21.6% to 31.2% of the population from 2010 to 2015 (2015 LCMS), however this access is concentrated in urban areas (67.7 %) with rural areas lagging behind (3.7%). Information on the reliability and quality of the electricity service is also limited. Additionally, while 17% of the total population has access to non-solid cooking solutions, there is another gap between the urban (39%) and rural (3.4%) populations (GTF, 2103). It is important to determine how to close this gap and promote universal access because pollution from solid fuel stoves causes eye problems and respiratory diseases in addition to environmental harm. This survey will collect data to identify the remaining energy deficiencies to target so Zambia can progress towards the SDG energy objectives. 
      World Bank-ESMAP with MoE, REA, ZESCO and CSO would like to hire the services of a reputed firm which has extensive experience in household surveys. This firm will conduct the baseline survey on energy access in Zambia using the Multi-Tier Framework (MTF) approach to track progress towards SDG7 and SE4ALL goal. The survey will be representative of the country and administered to both urban and rural localities. 
      The firm will work with the World Bank-ESMAP, MoE, REA, ZESCO and CSO to pre-test, finalize and implement the survey. The firm will provide capacity building to the CSO, MoE, REA and ZESCO to ensure continuity on tracking of energy indicators and integration into the national Living Conditions Monitoring Systems (LCMS). Data collection should be carefully monitored to ensure high quality information. After completing the fieldwork, the firm will deliver the final dataset and summary report to the World Bank-ESMAP. Additional details on the scope of work will be available in the Terms of Reference (ToR). 
      Interested firms should provide a brief summary of their qualifications to perform the services (max 3 pages). The short-listing criteria will be based on:
      1.	Experience in household surveys in sub-Saharan Africa, and specific experience in Zambia
      2.	Experience in the energy or other infrastructure sectors (e.g. water and sanitation)
      3.	In-depth understanding of the energy access sector and its socio-economic dimensions
      4.	Strong technical skills in qualitative/quantitative research and data analysis
      5.	Proven skill in using CAPI - tablet based data collection 
      6.	Cultural awareness in dealing with local communities, and interacting with government and local authorities
      7.	Excellent writing and analytical and presentation skills in English 
      Preferences will be given to local firm with high knowledge of the country energy sector and socio-economic context. International firms are encouraged to team up with local partners. The assignment should start in January 2017 and be completed by end of June 2017.
      Short-listed firms will be invited to submit a full technical and financial proposal for the final selection round.
