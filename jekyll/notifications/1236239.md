      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1236239 - Cost-Benefit Analysis of National Identity Management System Development in Zambia
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Zambia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      As countries seek to develop and roll out robust and inclusive national identification systems it is critical to develop estimations of the associated costs and benefits, for a number of reasons. Not only is an accurate estimation of costs and benefits critical to the decision-making process for a government, a favorable economic case could serve as compelling motivation beyond the archetypal social or security-related concerns. The Zambia Cost Benefit Analysis study will look at several (3-5) plausible scenarios possible in terms of organizational design and technical architecture for an integrated civil registration and identification project to identify possible pathways, organizational design (OD) options, institutional roles, costs and benefits, risks and mitigation of risks. It will address  (a) how and in which timeframe the civil registration system which currently has very low coverage can be made to fully function as the foundation for the integrated identity management system (b) what in the interim will be the course of action to maintain and further improve the coverage of the current national ID system, and (c) how and over which timeframe a new national ID system can be phased in that can serve for online authentication of identity. Among the benefits the CBA should look at cost savings for the four most-used (or most-to-be-used) applications of online, POS authentication, e.g. authentication of identity of voters, applicants of SIM-cards, new bank account holders and taxpayer authentication. The study should include validation of the IMSA Reports finding of possible under-budgeting for necessary investments in civil registration and identification.
