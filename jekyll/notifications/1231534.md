      Assignment Title: 1231534 - Serbia: Natural Gas Investment Screening and Appraisal Framework
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Serbia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank is assisting the Government of Serbia in the effort to reform the natural gas sector of the country, with a focus on the financial stabilization of national gas utility JP Srbijagas. In March 2016, the Government adopted a Financial Consolidation Plan (FCP) which defines measures to address the key challenges in the sector:  (i) lack of payment discipline and low collection of due receivables; (ii) unaffordable levels of debt; (iii) unsustainable network expansion and CAPEX program; (iv) acquisition of non-core business assets through debt to equity swaps with insolvent gas consumers (mostly state-owned); and (v) inadequate internal controls. 
      The consultant assignment in question is focused on Srbijgas investment program. Despite a slow-growing market, Srjijagas has an extensive CAPEX program. This has contributed significantly to the financial distress of the company, with most CAPEX targeted at expansion at distribution level failing to generate positive incremental revenues.
      
      The objectives of the assignment are the following: 
      1.	Development of an investment appraisal methodology for Srbijagas based on existing good practice in economic and financial cost benefit analysis. 
      2.	Development of criteria for classification, prioritization and optimization of existing CAPEX projects scheduled or committed to by Srbijagas.
      3.	In-depth scrutiny in the form of a legal and economic audit of the existing CAPEX program to identify possible cancellations, modifications or delays of planned projects.
      4.	Development of an investment plan 2017-21 that follows the new methodology and takes needed maintenance, repair and replacement CAPEX into account. 
      5.	Identification of the parameters of a reporting and monitoring system for the execution of Srbijagas CAPEX program.
