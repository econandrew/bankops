      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1213359 - Firm to Study State Capture in Ukraine
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Ukraine
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      In Ukraine along with other transition economies, corruption has taken on a new imagethat of so-called oligarchs or politically connected businesses manipulating policy formation and even shaping the emerging rules of the game to their own, very substantial advantage. We refer to this behavior as state capture. Though this form of grand corruption is increasingly being recognized as the most pernicious and intractable problem in the political economy of reform, few systematic efforts have been made to distinguish its causes and consequences from those of other forms of corruption.
      The suggested study would look into ways in which state captures works in Ukraine and analyze data and information to estimate impact of state capture on economic and social outcomes in the country.
      The following research questions are suggested for the study:
      1.	How is the concentration of economic power reflected in economic activity by sector and region? 
      2.	How do sectors with presence of politically connected businesses differ in terms of economic outcomes such as job creation, level of competition, productivity and profitability?
      3.	What is net economic cost of state capture (state benefits, economic impacts)? 
      4.	What are the major avenues for politically connected businesses to enjoy benefits from the state?
      (see TOR)
