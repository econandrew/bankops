      Open Risk Data Dashboard: Development of Risk Information Definitions, Software Platform, and Initial Content
      
      Expression of Interest
      
      I. Background
      The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a partnership of the World Bank, United Nations, major donors and recipient countries under the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) system to support the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). HFAs principal goal is to effectively integrate, in a coherent manner, disaster risk considerations into sustainable development policies, planning, programming, and financing at all levels of government. 
      
      GFDRR provides technical and financial assistance to help disaster-prone countries decrease their vulnerability and adapt to climate change. GFDRR works closely with UN agencies, client governments, World Bank regional offices, and other partners. GFDRR focuses on five pillars of action to further the Disaster Risk Management (DRM) agenda: Risk Identification, Risk Reduction, Preparedness, Financial Protection and Resilient Recovery. The Risk Identification pillar aims to improve access to information about disaster and climate risks in vulnerable countries and to support a greater capacity to create, manage and use this information. This pillar provides valuable and often critical inputs to the other pillars to reduce and manage disaster risk.
      
      GFDRR also hosts a team focused on the use of science, technology, and innovation to better empower decision-makers in the developing world to increase their resilience to disasters in a changing climate  the GFDRR Innovation Lab. The Innovation Lab strategy is to build partnerships and communities that utilize open data and open source technology to assist decision-making. Innovation Lab activities are designed and implemented in partnership with the World Banks regional DRM teams, governments and key international and local partners, which ensures that these initiatives are developed to add value in operational environments.
      Disaster risk assessments require extensive spatial and non-spatial data, including base data (e.g,. terrain and other natural features), hazard data (spatial distribution of hazard intensity), exposure (e.g., distribution of population, structures, and infrastructure), and vulnerability (socioeconomic data and relationships between hazard intensity and potential damage). Often, engagement in DRM projects across the globe is hindered by a lack of awareness of what data already exist, where to find it, and whether it is openly accessible. This project aims to streamline and promote the data collection and use process, by developing an online dashboard to present, for each country, data group (given above), and hazard type, an easily accessible assessment of what open data exists, a view of its content and how to access the data. This would provide a systematic way for DRM users and countries to determine what data exist for use in risk assessments for different purposes (e.g., national preparedness planning, site-specific investment, or financial protection). Key information about the data (including: where is it hosted and under what license(s) it can be used) would be provided to users in the dashboard. Moreover, a dashboard such as this will provide governments and the DRM community a way to track progress towards having all necessary datasets to assess risk through an aggregate dashboard. 
      
      II. Project objective, activities and requirements
      
      The objective of this project is to develop an online dashboard that will enable users to input, store, manage, explore and communicate information related to the status of availability, accessibility, and quality of key datasets related to natural hazard risks for a given country. Users of the dashboard may be specialists in a number of sectors related to, or using information originated for, DRM (i.e., the users may not be DRM specialists). Specifically, this may include the staff of governments and entities responsible for DRM in their locality, open data advocates, Right to Information Act (RTI) activists, and project staff of organizations in the DRM and development sectors.
      The project has three main activities:
      	Activity 1: developing the key definitions related to the datasets and the measurements of their accessibility, availability and fitness for purpose for various DRM applications for three hazard: flood, earthquake and cyclone.
      	Activity 2: developing the web software platform to store and track this information for each countries.
      	Activity 3: populating the platform with initial content for 5 then 10 key countries. This will be done in parallel with activity 1 and 2 to test the methodology and the platform.
      
      Activity 1 - Key risk datasets
      
      Key risk datasets definition - Define a limited list of key risk datasets, their definition, their content, including minimum criteria that datasets should meet, as well as a related simple classification scheme (taxonomy) for the datasets. This should be conducted in line with risk data standard practices, key dataset definitions and assessment methodologies, and through a collaborative and open research process. The classification scheme should be specific to the DRM sector and may include different categories/facets such as type of: hazard (earthquake, water scarcity, volcano, etc.); risk assessment (hazard, exposure, vulnerability); or action (risk identification, reduction, preparedness, financial protection, resilient recovery, etc.). Lastly, it is advised to reuse existing risk classification such as types of natural hazards from INSPIRE EU (http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/NaturalHazardCategoryValue). In this first phase, dataset definitions will be developed for flood, earthquake and tropical cyclones hazards and account for  exposure, vulnerability, hazard and other risk-related data.
      
      Key risk datasets openness and ease of use criteria - Define a limited set of data openness and ease of use criteria to be measured for each key risk dataset. This should be conducted in line with international open data principles, as well as with the OpenDRI principles. This set of criteria may include, but is not limited to whether the data are: already collected; in digital format; available online; machine-readable; free of charge; open licensed; up to date; and available with its metadata. Other criteria may be specific to DRM activities.
      
      Scoring methodology - Define a scoring methodology that should answer the following questions: 1) to what extent is a key risk datasets definition for a given country covered by existing datasets (availability)?; 2) how open and easy to use are these datasets (accessibility)?; and 3) how well that datasets meet the key dataset requirement outlined in the definition (fit-for-purpose/quality)? This should be defined in line and extend available open data assessment methodologies. 
      
      Activity 2 - Dashboard platform
      
      Design and develop a platform that integrates the definitions developed in activity 1 in a dashboard for users who require data of various types, for use in risk assessment of one or multiple hazards, and other related DRM applications. The key principles for development of the dashboard are: Ease of use, Collaboration, Openness, Transparency, Extensibility, Global Open Data Agenda.
      
      The dashboard should have the following functionality:
      Manual input mechanism - Identified users should be able to input information related to a selected key risk dataset for a given country. It should be possible to link different datasets to a key risk dataset definition for a given country. The tool should also provide a mechanism for non-identified users to submit key relevant datasets and sectoral guidance known of them for review.
      
      Reviewing mechanism - The input process should offer functionality for administrators to review and validate inputs from a user before a dataset is published. This would be on the basis of specified user permissions.
      
      Automatic input mechanism - The dashboard should include a process / tool to automatically retrieve or push metadata from other platforms such as open data and open geospatial data platforms (CKAN, Socrata, OpenDataSoft, GeoNode, etc).
      
      
      Store and manage - The dashboard should enable storage and management of key risk datasets definitions developed through activity 1 and the metadata related to the datasets. This will NOT include storing of the key datasets themselves, just linking to them where they are hosted. Metadata in that case refers to the criteria developed in Activity 1 around availability, accessibility, quality, documentation provided, etc. It does not include detailed metadata on the dataset itself as these would be stored along with the data and could be pulled automatically as described above. Management should include reviewing, validating, editing, removing, and adding metadata entries depending on defined users rights. 
      
      Explore and communicate - The dashboard should help users to easily understand, visualize and explore the status of key risk datasets for a given country at a given time. It should enable browsing datasets by categories, via content filter and search functions. It should allow comparison between territories in terms of key risk datasets availability. It should also enable users to see how close a specific dataset matches the definition of a key risk dataset for a given country.
      
      Documentation - Provide online documentation for the dashboard's users. This should include a User Guide and documentation of scoring methodology and criteria.
      
      
      Activity 3 - Preliminary input phase
      
      This activity will cover the preliminary input of identified datasets into the dashboard for countries where OpenDRI has already conducted data assessment missions. Five in a first alpha phase and then ten for the published version.
