      The World Bank (WB), with funding from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), is providing technical assistance to improve early grade literacy and school readiness in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific under the Pacific Early Age Readiness and Learning (PEARL) Program. The activities include but are not limited to carrying out surveys in multiple countries to: (i) inform implementation achievements and issues under a reading intervention being carried out in Tonga; (ii) inform an impact evaluation of the reading and school readiness interventions being carried out in Tonga; and (iii) provide governments with information and recommendations about how to improve school readiness and early literacy based on the survey results in Kiribati, Samoa and Solomon Islands.
      The WB are seeking assistance to support the planning, data collection, data entry, and data analysis required to complete the following assessments in 2017:
      	One mid-line (sample) and one endline (census of 126 primary schools) Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) in Tonga (Note: the instrument has already been developed and used on a digital interface in two iterations of the survey in Tonga in 2016).
      	One diagnostic EGRA in Samoa.
      	One diagnostic EGRA in Solomon Islands.
      	One diagnostic Early Human Capability Index (eHCI) survey in Kiribati.
      The following activities will need to be carried out by the successful firm:
      	Support the development and pre-testing of Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) instruments in Samoan (Samoa), and English (Solomon Islands).
      	Adapt EGRA instruments in each language to a Tangerine digital interface.
      	Support the development and pre-testing of Early Human Capability Index (eHCI) instruments in Gilbertrese/Kiribati (Kiribati).
      	Adapt eHCI instruments to an appropriate digital interface.
      	Provide assistance to government officials to organize logistics of training and data collection, and provide technical and organizational support during data collection of each survey in each country as listed above.
      	Organize and facilitate an enumerator and supervisor training in each country.
      	Provide support to government officials to complete data cleaning and/or data entry if paper forms were collected.
      	Analysis of data collected and results report drafting.
      The firm will be expected to work in collaboration with the Ministry of Education in each country and the Pacific regional assessment body, Educational Quality Assessment Program (EQAP), to strengthen their capacity in carrying out EGRA.
      Eligible firms should have experience with survey management, data collection, teacher training, and data analysis.
