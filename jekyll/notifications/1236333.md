      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1236333 - Fiji Civil Service Reform: Institutional Review of the Ministry of Education
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Fiji
      
      Project background:
      The Government of Fiji has commenced an ambitious program of civil service reform. Following a recent transition to democracy, improving the effectiveness of the public sector is viewed by the Fijian Government as key to building support for democracy and delivering on an ambitious program of public service and infrastructure investment. Governments priorities for the reform are threefold: i)successfully implement the devolved model of civil service management embedded within the new constitution; ii)reorient central agencies to align their roles and functions with the new devolved model, while increasing focus on delivery and efficiency across government; and coordinate policy and monitor performance; and iii)take advantage of new opportunities from technological innovation to increase the responsiveness, efficiency and accessibility of government.
      
      The civil service in Fiji faces systemic weaknesses in organizational and performance management, including the ability to retain professional and technical staff. In addition, ad hoc implementation of key civil service reforms and weakness in service delivery in some departments especially for excluded groups and in remote areas. Through the 2013 Constitution the government has adopted a devolved human resource framework to provide greater flexibility and autonomy to ministries and departments. The World Bank is supporting the government through the provision of technical assistance in leveraging institutional, human resource management and service delivery focused reforms that make the public service more accountability and efficient in helping it achieve development outcomes.
      
      Task background:
      The civil service reform program is currently focusing on a series of institutional reviews which are designed to assess the institutional framework and capabilities within the Ministry to ensure that the Ministries are well positioned to efficiently deliver services to Fijians. The institutional reviews are high-level diagnostic reports which assess the suitability of institutional arrangements within complex service delivery environments. The reviews are being conducted in an environment where information about institutional arrangements may be limited and the high-level nature of the reports will mean that there is greater reliance on the experience, expertise and knowledge of consultants to identify proven solutions that will work in the Fiji civil service context.
      
      The Ministry of Education, Heritage and the Arts is the largest ministry in the Fiji Government, with over half of the total number of civil servants based in this Ministry. The Ministry is responsible for primary, secondary and technical colleges throughout the country. Its roles also includes curriculum advisory and a comprehensive examination and testing role. It has a complex service delivery structure with over 900 schools nationwide, accommodating over 200,000 students. The Ministry also oversees a range of other statutory bodies in the education sector. The Ministry also coordinates Fijis culture sector, through the Department of Heritage and Arts. The Department implements culture-related policies through a range of statutory bodies.
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The objective of the assignment is to conduct an institutional review of the Ministry of Education, Heritage and the Arts to support a program of institutional modernization that enables the Ministry to meet staffing, human resource and service delivery challenges.
