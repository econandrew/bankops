      1.The FIRST-funded Lebanon: Strengthening Insurance Sector Regulation and Supervision Project seeks to assist the Insurance Control Commission (ICC) of Lebanon in the development of guidelines for the sound and consistent implementation of MTPL insurance (covering both bodily injury and material damage), and to support the development of a risk-based supervisory regime more broadly. This will contribute to increased insurance penetration, consumer protection, and stability.

      II.Quantitative Study: Collect, examine and analyze actual data and prepare a detailed report on the financial analysis and rating approach that it is recommended would be used, including quantitative elements based on a defined level of adequacy, and a risk based intervention supervisory ladder.
