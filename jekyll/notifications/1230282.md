      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1230282 - Somalia: Assisting Government with allocation of 4G mobile spectrum
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Somalia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      On behalf of the Federal Government of Somalia, the World Bank is seeking to employ a Firm to assist the Government in preparing and carrying out the licensing of frequency spectrum for the provision of Fourth Generation (4G) mobile broadband services. Specifically, the firm is expected to identify suitable frequency bands for licensing are to be identified and divided into spectrum blocks for allocation. Thereafter, the firm should accompany the government in managing the licensing process. Although the draft Communications Act foresees the establishment of an independent ICT regulator for Somalia, this has not yet been approved. Therefore, in the short term, the spectrum allocation process will be led by the Federal Ministry of Posts and Telecoms (MPT), in collaboration with sister Ministries in the administrations of the Federal Member States.
      
      B.	Objectives of the assignment:
      The overall objective of this assignment is to lead a spectrum allocation process on behalf of the FGS that will ensure the efficient use of spectrum suitable for 4G mobile services. A secondary objective is to maximise government revenue from the use of this spectrum.
      
      Specifically, the Consultant hired for the assignment will be expected to determine the status quo of current mobile spectrum usage in Somalia and forecast future spectrum demand, by conducting stakeholder interviews and spectrum surveys. Based on the results, suitable frequency bands for licensing are to be identified and divided into spectrum blocks for allocation.
      
      The regulatory environment in Somalia is to be examined and changes or additions identified that may be required to facilitate a spectrum allocation and licensing process.
      
      Taking Somalias particular market conditions, and security situation, into account, a valuation of the spectrum is to be carried out and target prices defined for the frequency allocation process. Different models for the allocation process should be evaluated, such as an auction or fixed-price, one-time and/or recurring fees, and recommendations made as to which model should be adopted.
      
      The Consultant will then accompany the MPT in preparing and managing the allocation process on behalf of the FGS. Throughout the entire assignment, stakeholder consultations are to be held, especially with the private sector telecom operators and potential foreign investors, to build consensus and industry support for the licensing process. 
      
      The Consultant should also work with the Federal MPT in discussing spectrum management, and fiscal arrangements, among those Federal Member States that wish to participate in the process.
      
      Finally, procedures are to be defined for the MPT, or the future regulator, to carry out its spectrum monitoring and management responsibilities on an ongoing basis. This should also be communicated to the private sector to build confidence and support for spectrum regulation and licensing.
