      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Background 
      
      The World Bank Group and the AfDB, together with other donors, such as the EIB, AFD, KfW/BMU, and the EC, have worked together to accelerate CSP deployment in the MENA region, using concessional financing available from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF). The CTFs MENA CSP Investment Plan (CTF MENA CSP IP), which was endorsed in December 2009, updated in November 2010 and revised in May 2013 and June 2014, aims to mobilize nearly US$ 5 billion (including US$553 million from the CTF) to accelerate the deployment of CSP projects in Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia, Jordan, Libya and possibly other MENA countries.  Despite slow progress on some projects, the MENA region has been at the forefront of the CSP technology deployment, thanks in large part to the successful launch the world-renowned 500 MW Noor-Ouarzazate solar complex in Morocco-- the largest CSP plant in the world. The MENA region, led by Morocco and Saudi Arabia, wants to remain a key player in a rapidly evolving market, reaping the benefits of technology improvements, cost reductions and derived socio-economic impacts.
      
      The purpose of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) MENA CSP Technical Assistance (CTF MENA CSP TA) Program, approved in July 2014, is to accelerate the implementation of the CTF MENA CSP IP and to ensure that associated social and economic benefits are fully achieved. The program aims to support the implementation of the CTF MENA CSP IP through improvement in regulatory and policy frameworks, assistance in project identification, development and preparation, support for the creation of ecosystems that attract investors in related products, equipment and services and capacity reinforcement in participating countries. By doing so, the CTF MENA CSP TA promotes strong local contribution and technology transfer, thereby improving the economic viability of CSP and ensuring that CSP development benefits the local population.
      
      Since the program launch, the CSP market has changed, with substantial cost reductions induced by large scale development in some regions of the world, and the situation in the participating countries has evolved, with Morocco moving forward swiftly to implement the 500 MW Noor-Ouarzazate plant, while the other participating countries are at a standstill. The changes in the CSP landscape make the technology increasingly attractive due to the thermal storage that it brings into the power system, as a complement to variable decentralised renewable energy technology, for those countries that aim at mastering the integration of higher shares of renewables into their power systems and attract low cost financing, in particular as part of the increasing climate finance flows to developing countries. Moreover, several of the participating countries are returning to political stability and are initiating low carbon programs, as indicated in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), where CSP figures prominently. Now is the time when the CTF MENA CSP TA can make a difference and give a boost to the full MENA CSP program, not only to the benefits of the MENA region, but also to all the countries that are initiating low carbon programs where CSP is playing a key role.
      
      The work under the present Terms of Reference (TOR) is part of an Action Plan to accelerate implementation of the CTF MENA CSP TA. The Action Plan aims at implementing the CTF MENA CSP TA in a doable and pragmatic way, including leveraging other initiatives, in order to provide the desired benefits to the participating countries, but also globally to all countries considering the use of CSP technology as part of their climate mitigation plans. Several studies and consulting activities will be undertaken under the Action Plan. The first one, which is the subject of the present TORs, is to update the knowledge on the status of the CSP industry and technology development over the last two years, to steer the whole program in the right direction.
      
      Objective
      
      The purpose of the 2016 CSP Review is to prepare a status report on the CSP technology, market and industry, covering all segments (and not just the large-scale plants), updating previous studies dating back to 2013 to reflect recent market developments, policy changes and climate change mitigation commitments following COP21trends briefly discussed in the background section. It will thus guide the work of the whole CTF MENA CSP TA, helping to focus on activities that are the most likely to have an impact on the ground.
