      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1235810 - Market Test of Clean Household Cookstoves in Turkana County
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Kenya
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The upcoming World Bank-sponsored Kenya Off-grid Solar Access Project (K-OSAP) aims to increase access to energy services in 14 underserved counties of Kenya. One of the components of the Project is a Clean Cooking Pilot which aims to transform the household cookstove market in the underserved counties from a focus on low-efficiency baseline stoves (Tiers 0-2) to cleaner, higher efficiency improved stoves (Tiers 2+). The Pilot will initially target four northwest counties, notably Turkana, West Pokot, Marsabit and Samburu. The pilot will scale up to other selected counties based on the results from the pilot in these initial four counties. The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum of the Government of Kenya.  
      
      The clean cookstove component is designed to stimulate market entrance of leading edge cookstove technology and manufacturing know-how through partnerships with local wholesaler and retail networks in the fourteen underserved counties.  A competitive grant facility will be launched to strengthen the distribution chain of selected efficient stoves in the target counties. The grant facility will provide early market entry support and result-based incentives to the sales of selected stove models.
      
      As a first step to identifying suitable technologies for the underserved county market in Kenya, the project team is issuing an Expressions of Interest (EoI) to obtain a long list of interested manufacturers of efficient solid fuel (wood, charcoal, and pellets) and clean (LPG and ethanol) cookstoves targeting consumers in the urban and peri-urban areas in Kenyas underserved counties.  
      
      The objective of this assignment is to carry out a field-based Market Test of Clean Cookstoves in Turkana County to gather information on the efficiency and fuel savings; consumer preferences; and durability under actual use of a set of 5 to 6 short-listed stoves.  The results will help understand (a) the value proposition stove models present to households, including the price consumers are prepared to pay as indication of stove desirability and (b) durability and performance of shortlisted stoves in actual use. 
      
      For each of the stove models, the consultant will assess:
      
      (i) Fuel economy: what savings accrue to consumers from the exclusive use of the stove to cook daily food needs compared to the baseline cooking technology before the intervention; 
      (ii) Consumer acceptance: what consumers find practical about each stove, and whether once introduced to the stove and trained in its proper use, they use it extensively in the trial period for everyday cooking needs;
      (iii) Willingness to pay/willingness to accept: whether consumers wish to retain the stove at the end of the trial period, and if so, what they are prepared to pay to keep it; and ;
      (iv) Durability performance: the nature of wear and tear during the first 4 months of use and whether the identified damage is detrimental to stove functionality and efficiency. 
      
      Outcomes of the assessment will inform:
      (i) The World Bank to narrow down a list of eligible technologies for the grants program and further refine the grant mechanism to provide the right incentives for market development. 
      (ii) Government of Kenya policy makers, providing an opportunity to improve the enabling environment and fiscal policies necessary to  support cleaner more efficient technologies compatible with cooking needs of the local population. 
      (iii) Manufacturers whose stoves have been included in these household assessments, by sharing the result of the assessment including the household feedback to their technology. 
      (iv) Local wholesalers and distributors to further inform the choice of technology for distribution and help narrow down the target market
