      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1234105 - PILOT ACTIVITIES FOR MONITORING AND REPORTING OF GHG EMISSIONS  AND ETS BENCHMARKS DEVELOPMENT
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Ukraine
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      This assignment consists of two major components: pilot monitoring and reporting (M&R) projects and a benchmarking study.
      
      Under the first component the Contractor is expected to support 9 installations in conducting pilot projects on preparation of a monitoring plan (MP) and an annual emission report (ER) preliminary for the following types of activities: fuel combustion, oil refining, production of iron and steel, production of ferrous alloys, production of cement, production of ammonia and production of coke. 
      The pilot MPs and ERs shall be primarily based on the Commissions Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 of 21 June 2012 on the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions, together with the national-level MRV requirements to be developed with support of the PMR project. The MPs and ERs produced under the scope of this assignment will subsequently be subject to pilot verification conducted as a part of a different assignment under the PMR Ukraine project. 
      The work under this component is expected to be based on, and performed in coordination with, the work on the development of the essential elements of the national MRV system (MRV legislation, calculation methodologies, templates for monitoring plans and  emissions reports, M&R guidance, tools and examples), being developed as a part of a different assignment under the PMR project.
      
      Within the scope of this component, the Contractor is expected to deliver the following results:
      	A monitoring plan and an emission report for each of the 9 pilot installations and operators capacity development in this respect;
      	Support for the installation operators during the pilot verification process;
      	MPs with detailed examples for each type of activity covered by the national MRV system.
      
      The overall objective of the second component of this assignment is to develop a set of GHG emission benchmarks suitable for use as an allowance allocation tool in the sectors considered for an ETS in Ukraine. Combining pilot MR projects and benchmarking in the same package is expected to provide significant synergies for both components. For the benchmarking purposes, cooperation with pilot installations in key sectors provides direct access to essential input data and gives useful insights into existing facility-level data collection procedures, as well as facilitates engagement of other important stakeholders like industrial associations and sectoral research institutions. On the other hand, the benchmarking exercise helps refine data requirements to be addressed by the pilot MR projects.
      It should be taken into account that, being by their nature specific (unit) emissions, i.e. carbon intensities of respective products, the benchmarks can be used in two ways. In a trading system with a cap on the absolute value of emissions, they are multiplied by historic levels of production of participating entities to determine the amount of allowances they receive (ex-ante allocation). Alternatively, in systems where the cap is expressed in terms of relative emissions rather than absolute emissions, the amount of allowances is calculated by multiplying respective product benchmark by the current output level (dynamic, or ex-post adjusted allocation). 
      
      The benchmarks development should reflect the countrys priority of embarking on the economic recovery along a low-carbon development path, and therefore provide incentives to carbon- and energy-efficient economic growth. The approach taken for benchmarks development has to reflect in a proper way the economic situation and technical conditions in potential ETS sectors and the country as a whole. The benchmarks are expected to provide the basis for informed decision-making process and, as such, need to be based on clear criteria for their definition, and sound data collection and calculation methodologies. Both the conceptual approach and the final findings and recommendations should become a subject for extensive stakeholder consultations to provide necessary feedback and ensure better understanding and acceptance of the benchmarks by the industries that may be affected by the ETS implementation.
      
      The following key results shall be achieved:
      	Input data for benchmarks development in potential ETS sectors collected;
      	Appropriate benchmarks for potential ETS sectors developed;
      	Relevant information materials prepared;
      	Sufficient stakeholder consultations conducted.
