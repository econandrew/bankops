      Assignment Title: 1231935 - Ethiopia Sector Modeling Consultant
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Ethiopia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The objective of this assignment is to perform a financial analysis of Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and Ethiopian Electric Utility and develop a financial model for the sector with a specific aim of understanding the ability and extent of EEP's capabilities to contract renewable IPPs.
      
      The Consultant will assess the sustainability of the sector and the financial condition of EEP (i) historically over the past 5 years and (ii) forecasted over the next 10 years.  Key aspects to be looked at are as follows:
      A.	Current financial situation of the sector
      o	Analysis of EEP and EEU financial statements over the past five years including:
      	A review of their operating charges, distinguishing between the maintenance/direct charges and operational/indirect charges such as salaries.
      	A review of their financial charges including a breakdown of the different type of debts and their related costs,
      	A review of the total system losses distinguishing between technical transmission and distribution losses, and commercial losses.
      o	Presentation and analysis of sector cash flows, including:
      	EEP and EEU revenue and tariff formula components.
      	Establishment of historical and projected sector cash flows using a waterfall approach in terms of priority of payments (from customers through EEU (including export revenues) to EEP and the different IPPs, down to the balance/deficit to the state); this should include any taxes collected or paid back by the government, payments to other regulatory bodies, and maintenance cost of the plants at EEP level. 
      	If cash flow results in any deficit, historical analysis of the subsidy (amount and delay of payment of the subsidy), and estimation of necessary public or export tariff increase to offset deficit.
      	Assessment of current tariff levels considering:
      	If tariffs cover actual costs of power supply (generation, transmission and distribution).
      	If not, are the subsidies sustainable?  Are they likely to be reduced or eliminated in the future?
      o	Assessment of EEPs implementation capacity: on time planning, tendering (to EPC or IPPs) or building of generation and transmission projects.
      o	Using EEP Financial statements for the past 5years, Management Accounts, and Management reports, analyze financial and investment plan attached to projections. Potential donor funding allocations to the sector are also to be analysed against actual investments in the electricity sector over the past 5 years. 
      o	Assessment of on and off balance sheet financing of large energy infrastructure investments (e.g. the large volume of short term bonds/liabilities on the books).
      o	Assessment of other issues in the power sector including: availability of hard currency, land acquisition, governance (e.g., between central and local governments), etc.
      
      B.	Sector financial situation outlook
      o	Prepare a financial model which will contain financial projections (including financial statements) for EEP and EEU over the next 10 years, including: 
      	Cost of operations in distribution and transmission.
      	Cost of generation (current and future, in view of scheduled investments).
      	Financing of new investments (generation, transmission and distribution). 
      o	Revenues using current tariffs in real terms, whether there is a sector excess or deficit, and any subsidies the Government will need to pay to fund the deficit.
      o	If deficits are projected: 
      	Determine the tariff that will ensure EEUs economic and financial equilibrium, and discuss the proposed tariff's affordability.
      	Develop different scenarios for cross subsides between different classes of consumers.
      o	Presentation and analysis of projected sector cash flows, including the same details as the historical cash flows in section a) above, clearly indicating assumptions made.
      o	An analysis focusing on different Solar IPP options: 
      	The introduction of IPPs in Ethiopia will see the introduction of capacity payments and deemed energy concepts. For the PV plants, which are expected to be on an IPP basis, they will receive an energy payment - whether or not they are dispatched - given the deemed energy regime, hence the costs side of the sector will include the detailed forecast payments to these IPPs in full.
      	Also, the Consultant will simulate scenarios for EEP and EEU's financials:
      	EEU purchases only part of the Solar IPPs production. 
      	EEU purchases all Solar IPP production and trades it, exporting all of it at peak while importing base load. 
      	Others to be determined.
       
      Note: This assessment will be done using financial information provided by EEU, EEP, and MoWIE. Also depending on the findings in regards to the ongoing unbundling between EEP and EEU, the Consultant might need to present EEU financial projections as well (in any case, EEP/EEU revenues and costs should be reflected in the sector cash flow projections).
