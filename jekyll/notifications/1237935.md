      The World Bank and DFID are partnering with the National Planning Commission of the Government of Nepal (GoN) to conduct a three-year panel survey between 2016 and 2018 on household risk and vulnerability in Nepal. The survey will help the GoN identify gaps in the safety net and develop programs to help households cope with shocks.
      
      The objective of this consultancy is to implement the second round of the proposed three wave panel survey. Conditional on performance, it is expected that the contract would be extended to cover the third and final wave.  High quality quantitative data will be collected on household risk and vulnerability. The survey will include modules on consumption, employment, income, health, shocks (e.g., economic or health shocks, natural disasters) experienced in the past year and coping strategies employed (e.g., taking loans, selling assets or reducing food consumption) in order to address the following research questions:
      
      - What significant adverse events (both anticipated and unanticipated) are faced by households during a given year?
      
      - What strategies do households employ, and what systems of informal support do they rely on (ex-ante and ex-post) to cope with these events?
      
      - How are households short and medium term welfare affected by these events?
      
      - What formal government assistance do households receive? Is it sufficient to help them cope?
      
      The planned survey will be nationwide, re-interviewing a sample of 6,000 households. Fieldwork is expected to take place between May and July 2017. A draft version of the survey will be provided to the consultant. The consultant is expected to undertake all relevant activities to successfully administer the survey, including piloting and refining the questionnaire, recruiting and training enumerators, field mobilization, data collection, entry, and processing, under the overall supervision of a World Bank team. Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) will be used for data collection using the Survey Solutions platform. Final deliverables will be a cleaned survey dataset and supporting documents. 
      
      
      QUALIFICATION CRITERIA:
      
      Strong and proven experience in research design, quantitative research methods and conduct of large household surveys in Nepal with diverse populations across all three ecological belts. Past experience conducting panel surveys is a plus.
      1.	Demonstrated capacity to train and mobilize high quality enumerators nationwide for field survey/data collection implementation in Nepali.
