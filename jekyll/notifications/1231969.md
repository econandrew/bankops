      ENHANCING WOMENS MARKET ACCESS IN AGRIBUSINESS IN MOZAMBIQUE
      
      World Bank Africas Gender Innovation Lab
      
      Request for Expressions of Interest for a consultancy to develop all aspects of a World Bank Gender Innovation Lab funded intervention in the province of Tete, Mozambique. The intervention will supply female smallholder farmers with (i) agricultural extension training, and (ii) non-cognitive/behavioural skills training.
      
      REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
      Agriculture is the major source of income for rural households in Mozambique (province of Tete). Market orientation however is strikingly low  especially for women  with most of the farmers specializing in staple or subsistence crops. The World Bank invites interested parties to submit expressions of interest for implementation of an intervention that will provide women farmers with (i) agricultural extension training, and (ii) noncognitive/behavioural skills training. This intervention is part of a randomized impact evaluation designed by the World Bank Africas Gender Innovation Lab (GIL).
      
      The intervention will take place in 100 small rural communities. These will be divided into 2 groups of 50 communities each. In group 1, 20 women within each community are expected to receive agricultural extension training. In group 2, 20 women within each community are expected to receive agricultural extension training and the noncognitive/behavioural skills training.
       
      Working under the supervision of the World Banks Africa Gender Innovation Lab, the selected firm will be expected to (i) successfully develop and implement all aspects of the agriculture training intervention, and (ii) work in close collaboration with a team of psychologists in the implementation of the non-cognitive skills training component. The team of psychologists have experience in fostering the psychological success factors in entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa, and are part of GILs research team. The team of psychologists will develop the modules to be taught by the selected firm using a training of trainers approach. 
      
      Interested firms should provide information demonstrating that they have the required qualifications and relevant experience to perform the services. The shortlisting criteria are: (i) proven track record of successfully implementing large-scale agricultural extension interventions in sub-Saharan Africa aimed at promoting the adoption and marketing of cash crops; (ii) proven track record of successfully implementing large-scale development interventions targeted to women; and (iii) proven target record of organizing large scale training programs.
      
      Consultant firms may associate with other firms in the form of a joint venture or a sub-consultancy to enhance their qualifications. The expression of interest may include brochures, description of similar assignments, experience in similar conditions, availability of appropriate skills among staff, etc.
