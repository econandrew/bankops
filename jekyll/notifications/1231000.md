      VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS OF COTTON APPAREL IN AGRIBUSINESS IN KENYA
      
      
      Background 
                          
      As part of a program of analytical work which aims to support job creation and competitiveness in Kenya, the World Bank Group intends to contract a consultancy to carry out a jobs-focused value chain study for cotton-apparel in in Kenya. The value chain study will focus on understanding and quantifying the nature of jobs and skills requirements in the value chain, as well as the network of relationships across the chain, the opportunities and challenges facing firms, and their strategic responses. It should result in action plans aimed at improving the competitive position of local firms and the overall efficiency of the value system, while putting emphasis on job creation and earnings growth for women, youth and the most vulnerable, in particular through linking firms as well as microenterprises and the self-employed more effectively into competitive value chains. 
      Objective of the assignment
      
      The World Bank Group is seeking a firm to carry out a value chain assessment in cotton-apparel in Kenya.
      
      The scope of the assignment
      
      The assignment will include three major components: (1) Completion of value chain mapping exercise and generation of suitable sampling frames covering each link of the value chain identified in the mapping exercise; (2) Surveying a representative sample of operations or establishments in each link using a standardized survey instrument using face-to-face interviews with business owners and managers; (3) Implementing semi-structured qualitative interviews over a selection of stakeholders to inform data analysis  
      
      The scope of work and tasks for the study includes the following: 
      
      	The consultant will work to look in depth at the cotton-apparel value chain to identify potential obstacles to greater growth. Depending on the location of the main economic activities throughout the value chain, the analysis may focus on specific geographic areas.
      	The selected consultants will be expected to carry out a detailed mapping of the actors in the different links of the value chains. The instruments to be administered by the firm will further cover firm dynamics; costs, productivity, and jobs (scale and skills demanded); and barriers to competitiveness, value chain deepening, and job creation at each stage.  In addition, the instruments will cover cross-cutting issues such as the costs of trade, as well as labor market rigidity and costs, and education and skills. 
      	
      	The selected consultant will be applying both quantitative and qualitative instruments:
      o	Quantitative: Firm surveys administered to a representative sample of firms at each level of the value chain, to better understand firm decision-making with regard to labor use and suppliers. This sample will include firms that are already part of the supply chain of lead firms, but will also go beyond the existing chain to cover firms that are fully representative of the domestic value chain, including microenterprises and informal establishments.
      o	Qualitative: Semi-structured process of surveys, other forms of conversation with business owners (eg- business owners), and other key stakeholders in the value chain including government, related institutions like education and TVET providers etc. 
      	The World Bank will provide the quantitative and qualitative instruments to be administered. The firm is expected to contribute to adapting the instrument to the local context.
      	The consultant will be responsible for data entry and cleaning, and timely delivery of data in STATA or SPSS format. For the qualitative data, the outputs are expected to be delivered as specified formats.
      	The consultant will be responsible for gathering information from the local authorities, business and community leaders and other pertinent stakeholders for the value chain mapping, survey design and qualitative surveys as needed.
      
      Reporting and Working arrangements
      
      The consultant will need to work closely with the World Bank team in carrying out the value chains mapping, as well as piloting and implementing the quantitative and qualitative survey instruments.
