      Short-term Consultant (STC), Blended Finance Department
      International Finance Corporation
      
      Background:
      The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank Group, is a global investor and advisor committed to promoting sustainable private sector development in developing countries as a way to reduce poverty and improve people's lives. IFC finances private sector investments, mobilizes capital in the international financial markets, helps clients improve social and environmental sustainability, and provides technical assistance and advice to governments and businesses in emerging markets. The Blended Finance Department (BFD) seeks to support transactions that catalyze private sector investment in developmentally impactful projects that are just at the threshold of commercial viability but need some concessional finance to de-risk or help rebalance the risk-reward profile of these project to draw in private sector investors. To that end, BFD manages various pools of contributor funds aimed at meeting various development objectives in the most challenging environments and poorest countries, and for priority sectors such as climate change, agriculture and food security, SME finance. The BFDs role is to optimize the co-investment of funds from contributors, on concessional terms and considering the contributors risk appetite, and in line with principles endorsed by IFCs Board and Senior Management.  The BFD works closely as a cross-cutting product group, with industry investment teams and regional departments within IFC.  
      
      Currently, within the climate change area, BFD manages approximately $700 million in concessional funds to support projects that (a) seek to achieve transformation towards low-carbon and climate-friendly economic environments (e.g., change within an industry sector / sub-sector in a particular country or set of countries), (b) help enable private sector initiatives in other areas (e.g., market development) that would contribute to addressing the climate change challenge; (c) support private sector engagement in climate change adaptation (resilience) strategies.  Such concessional funds are able to accept higher risk / lower return than commercial funds while not providing pure grants.  Contributors of concessional funds overtime have become more interested in protecting their capital on a portfolio basis and receiving reflows (i.e., returnable capital").
      
      BFD is seeking to hire a short term consultant (STC) to primarily support the departments work on climate change, although some overarching work on blended finance in IFC as they related to other areas and sectors will also be part of the STCs remit. S/he will report to the BFD Manager. The position will provide the successful candidate with an opportunity to work across different sectors and regions within a creative and results based environment.
