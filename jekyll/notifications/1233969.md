      BACKGROUND
      The Ministry of Industry Trade and Cooperatives (MoITC) developed the Kenya Industrial Transformation Program (KITP) whose aim is to drive Kenya towards becoming a primary industrial hub for Africa through targeted sector specific interventions.  To support the implementation of KITP, the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice (T&C GP) of the World Bank Group is currently implementing targeted interventions to foster competitiveness. These interventions include a focus on Clothing Textiles and Apparel (CTA), and in particular on businesses in export processing zones (EPZ) and in upcoming special economic zones (SEZs).
      Textiles are a major driver of industrial export growth and key to Kenyas ambition of becoming an industrial hub in Africa. Since the institution of the AGOA agreement, Kenya textile and apparel exports have grown to USD 415 million accounting for 30% of industrial growth over the past 5 years. The CTA value chain has huge potential for growth and job creation as evidenced by the recently concluded CTA value chain analytics undertaken jointly by T&C GP and MoITC.
      
      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      Kenyas textile and apparel producing sector has two different and largely separate groups: producers who manufacture for the local and regional market; and firms that manufacture for export, many of which are foreign-owned enterprises. However, despite a relatively mature local textile-apparel sector, there are few linkages between the local sector and the larger export-focused firms, with the majority of the large exporters inputs coming from outside of Kenya. 
      This is a missed opportunity for Kenyan firms, who could generate business and jobs by linking into the larger exporting firms. 
      
      This assignment therefore focuses on understanding the scope for increasing the linkages between the local economy and Kenyas apparel exporters, developing a clear strategy for closing the gap between apparel exporters demand and the ability of local suppliers to meet it. The study will have a special focus on the existing EPZs and large FDI in this sector to identify actions to encourage the development of linkages with the domestic sector/SMEs in the CTA value chain and anchor FDI in Kenyas zones.
