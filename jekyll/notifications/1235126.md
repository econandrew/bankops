      I.	OBJECTIVE
      The World Bank Group seeks to hire a Firm to conduct a scoping study on FinTech solutions to support the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) in the implementation of the MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive finance, a $500 million Lending Project, including technical assistance, from the World Bank Group to SIDBI in India. 
      
      The MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive finance project focuses on expanding access to finance and innovating on financial products to MSMEs in three key underserved sectors: (i) startups and risk capital financing, (ii) the service sector, and (iii) the manufacturing sector to help unlock the market for lending to MSMEs at all stages of growth. Furthermore, the World Bank SIDBI project, also seeks to expand access to financing of MSMEs across Low Income States (LIS), and North-East India (NEI) wherever possible, as well as focus on women entrepreneurs. SIDBI will directly provide funding to end-beneficiaries (MSMEs including start-ups/early stage) and will also on-lend to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) that will then lend to MSMEs (refinancing).
      
      This assignment aims to inform SIDBI on how to possibly make use of FinTech solutions to enhance access to finance for MSMEs including start-ups/early stage firms. The objective would also be to define the role that can be undertaken by SIDBI to develop the FinTech sector in the form of taking over policy advocacy with regulators and building up accelerator/ incubator facilities.
      
      The study includes the following sub-objectives:
      (1) Better understanding of FinTech models and existing frameworks.
      (2) Identifying possible ways to support SIDBIs lending strategy and the SIDBI-WBG MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive Finance Program objectives; this could be either through a specific-FinTech product proposition or tools and/or or through possible partnerships between SIDBI and existing FinTech Companies to enhance access to finance to MSMEs including early-stage MSMEs/Entrepreneurs.
      (3) Exploring ways to partner with the existing FinTech Companies in India and take on a policy advocacy role on their behalf towards their strategic positioning with stakeholders, such as regulators, incubators, etc.
