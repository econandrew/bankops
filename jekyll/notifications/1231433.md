      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Assistance to Business Correspondent Federation of India (BCFI) to develop Business Requirement Document
      
      Agent networks in India play a critical role in promoting financial access, by helping financial service providers reach out to under banked areas. In the wake of recent financial inclusion initiatives by Government of India and other stakeholders, there has been a rapid growth in agent networks, with greater focus on building the infrastructure and increasing access points. 
      
      In the coming days, viability of agent banking would depend on the quality of services provided (irrespective of the location, product or agent model). Considering the multiplicity of agent banking model, there is a critical need to identify the varied potential risks/challenges and adopt a comprehensive approach, in order to ensure that expected gains in financial access are not negated by risks to both institutions and clients.
       
      In this context, Business Correspondent Federation of India (BCFI) is working with key stakeholders towards setting up standardized systems and processes that address both supply and demand side challenges holistically with support from IFC, DFID and SIDBI. This involves: putting  in  place standard  operational guidelines for business correspondents, irrespective of the business model; development of Code of Conduct for the agent banking sector; instituting effective monitoring and supervision mechanisms for BCFI; agent training and certification through online training modules and mobile apps; financial capability building of current and potential financial inclusion clients of agents; and implementing effective client grievance redressal mechanisms to improve customer protection and build their trust in the system.
      
      BCFI is evaluating its options for a technology solution to assist them in implementing and scaling up all the components mentioned above. 
      
      In this background, IFC in partnership with BCFI, supported by DFID/SIDBI is hiring a consultant/firm to develop a clearly articulated Business Requirements Document (BRD) that describes the business/user requirements of the above mentioned product/process and the intended end-result, which will help BCFI achieve its objective. The BRD development process and the final document should help BCFI to:
       Based on interaction with stakeholders, arrive at a comprehensive documentation of user requirements, acceptable to all.
       Suggest options for BCFI w.r.t tech solutions, (with key attributes defined) to meet the current and future business/user needs and objectives. Prioritize options based on the relative strengths and weaknesses. Provide detailed analysis of top 3 options.
       Define processes, resource requirements and detailed description of the business needs that will be met by the proposed solution/s
       Assist BCFI to identify and communicate to technology service provider/s about the needed solution/s to meet the business needs
       The final output will be a comprehensive high quality BRD meeting international standards covering but not limited to the above
      
      The qualifying firm for the BRD preparation phase will be eligible to participate in the selection process for any subsequent phases. The outputs of the BRD preparation phase will be available to the firms participating in the selection process for any subsequent phases.
