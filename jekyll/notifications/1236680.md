      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The objective of this activity is to provide technical and advisory assistance to the Climate Change Directorate (DCC) at the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), the PMR-Costa Rica technical team and relevant stakeholders throughout the process of (i) reviewing and updating of the current National Carbon Neutrality Plan (NCNP) and (ii) reforming and strengthening the current (voluntary) Domestic Carbon Market (DCM) as to transition into a transformation-oriented Costa Rican Offset Mechanism (Mecanismo de Compensación de Costa Rica, MCCR). These instruments are intended to stimulate enhanced mitigation action in priority sectors and contribute to Costa Ricas ambitious climate goals set out in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. In the context of Costa Ricas participation in the Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR), the World Bank is contracting consultant services to support the technical team anchored at the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), currently in charge of carrying out this work.
      
      
      This assignment will comprise activities/tasks and deliverables along the following specific objectives: 
      
      (1)	Review the current National Carbon Neutrality Plan (NCNP; Programa País Carbono Neutralidad), and provide advice on technical, institutional and regulatory issues during the redesign process of the NCNP, to broaden its appeal and to align it with the long-term deep decarbonization goal of Costa Rica. 
      
      (2)	Develop detailed technical inputs for draft operational guidelines, rules and modalities for the updated NCNP, including revised certification system (expanding from single-level recognition (C-Neutrality) toward multiple certificate levels (inventory, neutrality)); enhanced GHG reporting program structure and requirements (i.a., program coverage/classification of organizations, emissions quantification methodologies,   guidance on uncertainty and materiality, quality control and assurance procedures); third-party audit/verification system (incl. accreditation scheme for Certified Carbon Experts ("Peritos de Carbono"); others.
      
      (3)	Develop detailed policy options and technical notes to inform decision-making for the strategic transition of the voluntary Domestic Carbon Offset Market (DCM) towards a transformation-oriented Costa Rican Offset Mechanism (MCCR), in alignment with the long-term decarbonization goals of Costa Rica.
      
      (4)	Develop detailed technical inputs for draft operational guidelines, rules and modalities for the reformed MCCR, including, inter alia, guidelines for the selection of priority sectors and technology types for the generation of Costa Rican Offset Units (Unidades Costarricenses de Compensación, UCCs); guidelines for open tenders for scaled-up UCC asset creation (proposals for GHG emissions reductions crediting in transformational mitigation actions in priority sectors); guidelines for the development of methodologies and protocols for the generation of UCCs (for select transformational mitigation actions).
       
      (5)	Develop and launch a capacity building program for the Technical Secretariat of the updated NCNP and its reformed MCCR, anchored at the Climate Change Directorate/Ministry of Energy and Environment.
      
      These activities will be led and supervised by the Climate Change Directorate/MINAE, with the support of the PMR-Costa Rica technical team. The assignment is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2017 and shall be planned to be carried out in 9-12 months, subject to further coordination with the client counterparts at MINAE.
