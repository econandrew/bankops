      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Under the terms of this consultancy, it is envisioned that the consultant will support the relevant Contracting Authorities (CA) and undertake studies that will consider the projects in light of the economic, legal, financial, market, socio/environmental, affordability and value for money factors. The studies will allow the CA to determine the projects viability, whether they should pursue a PPP solution for the selected facilities, and what form of PPP should be developed. 
      In brief, the consultant is being engaged by the CA to provide the CA with sufficient information to justify acceptance, modification or rejection of the proposed projects for further financing and implementation. The CA is the ultimate beneficiary and the decision making body, and each aspect of the consultants activities and deliverables will be subject to CAs review and approval. The tasks will be completed in consultation with the CA and the other relevant government agencies.
