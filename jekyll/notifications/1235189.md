      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank Group (WBG) is seeking an expression of interest from well-qualified survey firms to conduct an SME Confidence Survey in Kuwait. The assignment will involve conducting face-to-face survey of a representative sample of businesses (micro, small, medium, and large) in Kuwait on a quarterly basis for a period of 12 months. The main purpose of the quarterly surveys is to collect information which will help monitor the current business situation in the country and predict short-term developments.  This regular reading of the pulse of the private sector may also provide indications about turning points in the business cycle and deeper problems which could be analyzed further. In the Business Confidence Surveys, business managers basically report on their current business situation compared to the immediate past and anticipate business conditions for the near future.
