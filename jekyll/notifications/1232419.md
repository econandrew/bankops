      The World Bank is seeking a Consultant/Firm to conduct a review of social impacts due to labor influx in World Bank investment project financing and to develop a Labor Influx Situation Analysis of selected projects. 
      
      This review is intended to help strengthen social impact and risk assessment and management regarding labor influx during project preparation and implementation of Bank-financed investment projects. The impetus for this review is both recent Bank experience and more broadly to improve risk assessment - identified as one among eight action areas in the World Banks corporate action plan on safeguards management and resettlement practices in 2015. 
      
      The proposed review will assess the active portfolio of World Bank Investment Project Financing to identify significant social risks related to labor influx, proposed and planned mitigation measures and effectiveness of actions proposed.  The output of this exercise is expected to help determine (i) whether the spectrum of social risks associated with labor influx are being correctly identified at WB project screening/Environment and Social Management Plan preparation stage; (ii) whether mitigation measures addressing social risks associated with labor influx are effective; and (iii) whether measures to ensure effective implementation, supervision, monitoring and reporting are incorporated.
      
      The proposed activities of the review are to: (i) conduct a desk review of a selected sample of projects in the Banks active portfolio to identify projects with labor influx issues and those with mitigation measures and actions undertaken. The review should identify (a) projects that have labor influx issues which have not been flagged in project documentation, (b) projects which have flagged the issues but have not incorporated appropriate mitigation measures and (c) projects that have both flagged labor influx issues and included mitigation measures and actions; (ii) undertake site visits to a limited sub-set of identified projects so as to analyze the identification, assessment, design modifications, mitigation management decisions, implementation, monitoring, supervision, reporting and stakeholder engagement approaches utilized on labor influx issues; (iii) draft a report to include summary of key findings, case studies of projects visited and operational recommendations, including specific measures to address issues related to labor influx - for Bank project task teams, Bank clients, and contractors - to manage social risks associated with labor influx.
