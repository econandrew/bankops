      The WBG intends to contract a consultancy/firm to carry out a jobs-focused value chain (VC) data collection/survey in specified regions in Burkina Faso. The study will focus on 2 value chains, as well as the network of relationships across the chains. The chains are (i) poultry (with a focus on eggs) and (ii) beef (with a focus on meat and trade of live cattle).
      Assignment components:
      Completion of the value chain mapping/listing and generation of sampling frames covering each link of the value chain (mapping of ca. 3,200 respondents along the entire value chains);
      Surveying a representative sample of business owners and managers in each link using CAPI (face-to-face) with ca. 1,100 respondents drawn from the mapping.
      Implementing semi-structured qualitative interviews (individual and focus groups) over a selection of stakeholders (ca. 80 individual interviews and 6 focus groups).
      Preparation of a report on findings from the quantitative and qualitative surveys.
