      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The PAF in conjunction with EDGE and the World Bank's Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) has been exploring the opportunity of combining the PAF climate auction model with EDGE voluntary certification to catalyze the green building sector in developing countries and to help avoid lock-in to energy inefficient, polluting, and expensive assets. Under this approach, the PAF would offer an innovative, results-based approach to incentivizing private sector investment.  The EDGE certification would provide a metric against which to disburse funds
