      Credit infrastructure Global Solutions Group
      
      The Credit Infrastructure Global Solutions Group (GSG) assists client governments and the global community in improving access to credit. We do this primarily through the establishment and strengthening of credit reporting, secured transactions and insolvency & debtor/creditor rights (ICR) systems. We have a special focus where the infrastructure for credit remains a huge obstacle for SMEs. The GSG provides advice to clients helping them reform legal and regulatory frameworks, creating and/or strengthening related institutions, including electronic registries, raising awareness and building capacity as well as monitoring impact. In addition, the GSG leads the setting of international standards in certain areas of credit infrastructure and promotes global expertise. In particular, this GSG carries out the World Bank Group's mandate as the global standard-setter for ICR, as designated by the Financial Stability Board.
      
      Ghana Secured Lending Framework
      
      Ghana secured lending framework focuses on increasing the private sector access to credit in the country by strengthening lenders' rights in movable assets.  This in turn will expand the variety of collateral lenders will accept, promote increased lending to MSMEs, as well as improve risk management through more effective collateral arrangements. This objective will be achieved through a) effective legislative reforms resulting in amendment of the Borrowers and Lenders Act which will enhance rights of creditors in movable assets; b) creation of functioning movable asset registries to enable lenders to effectively file a notice related to their proprietary rights, and c) awareness raising and capacity building activities for both public and private sectors, to increase knowledge among stakeholders about the benefits of well-functioning secured financing systems. 
      
      Credit Enforcement Process
      
      In Ghana, despite the establishment of commercial courts and the collateral registry, there is still a perceived risk around the financial institutions ability to enforce its right as a creditor which limits lending particularly to the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) segment. In this context, F & M GP is seeking to hire a Legal Firm (Consultant) with strong knowledge of the Ghanaian legal context, the collateral registry regulatory framework, including the Borrowers and Lenders Act and enforcement processes, to undertake an evaluation process that will assess creditors ability to enforce their rights against movable collateral in case of default. The aim of this evaluation exercise is to aid policy development and decision making that will strengthen credit enforcement practices within the financial sector. The legal firm is expected to produce a written report of methodology, findings and recommendations. The legal firm will also maintain regular communication of progress with the members of the F & M Collateral Registry project team and external stakeholders during the performance of duties.
