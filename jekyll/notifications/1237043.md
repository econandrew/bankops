      The World Bank recently launched the Assessment of Training Providers initiative to identify the current conditions and common practices under which technical and vocational education and training institutions operate as well as those conditions and practices that contribute to good performance
      
      This assessment aims to help the World Bank Groups partner countries to fill an information gap regarding two questions: first, what are the conditions and practices that make a training provider successful in terms of generating graduates who are employable or able to enroll in further education or training activities; and second, what are the most common constraints that training providers face and how have successful institutions addressed them.
      
      Scope of Work and Inputs from the World Bank: 
      The assessment will cover the whole country, and will be conducted in two phases: 1) landscape mapping and 2) quality assessment. 
      
      The first phase will begin by mapping the short-term training provision landscape through the collection of data on a range of variables. The World Bank Group will provide a Mapping Tool which will be customized by the selected firm/consultant(s) under the direction of the WBG and in consultation with the client country. At a minimum, the Mapping Tool should collect the name of institutions, their contact information (i.e. address/phone numbers), their affiliation (e.g. public, private, not-for profit), program offerings. Space to consider other variables, such as legal status, institutions size, among others are also available and can be used when the information is available and helpful. As a first step, the list of companies which offers educational services will be requested by the Ministry of Education from the State Registration Chamber. Next step, the received list of companies will be cheeked by the Ministry of Education with the Fiscal Inspectorate for identification of companies with turnover in last two years. 
      
      The firm/consultant is expected to complete the mapping exercise as follows:
      (i)	Customize the Mapping Tool: The Mapping Tool is designed to be easily adapted to ensure customization to the country context. After conducting the primary landscape scan, the firm/consultant(s) will identify the readily available information for most training providers and then adjust the tool accordingly. The World Bank will be able to provide technical assistance with the customization of the Mapping Tool. The final set of variables that are included in the Mapping Tool will be agreed with the World Bank Group and Ministry of Education;
      (ii)	The list of short term training providers sent by the Ministry of Education will be contacted by phone in order to check the companies current status (active/non-active). For the companies identified as being active the firm/consultant will complete the Mapping tool;
      (iii)	 Populate Mapping Tool database: The firm/consultant(s) fill out the background information about identified providers requested in the Mapping Tool. The World Bank Group will conduct a check to make sure that the database is filled out consistently and accurately; 
      (iv)	Analyze the database to produce a summary of the short term training provision landscape: The firm/consultant(s) will produce a five pages report that looks across the various categories of the database to generate a picture of the training provision landscape in the country. This would include basic insights regarding the distribution of providers in terms of geographic location, type of training institution, enrollment and graduation, and industry focus, among others; 
      (v)	Based on the collected information, the firm/consultant(s) will identify at least 20 short term training providers for the next phase of the study. The distribution of short term training providers (geographic, sectors, length of courses etc.) will be agreed with the Ministry of Education and the World Bank Group. 
      For the second phase, the firm/consultant(s) will conduct a quality assessment of the training providers by gathering more in-depth information focusing on the characteristics, practices, values, and performance of a sample of institutions. The World Bank Group will provide a Quality Assessment Tool which will be customized by the selected firm/consultant(s) under the direction of the WBG and in consultation with the client country. The methods to gather data will be the following: 
      (i)	Prepare a Methodology Note: The Methodology Note will describe staffing, sampling, field work timeline including a piloting phase, implementation arrangements, quality assurance framework, and cost. The World Bank Group will select a sample of 50 companies using the completed Mapping Tool and pre-established stratification criteria;
      (ii)	Customize the Quality Assessment Tool: The Quality Assessment Tool is designed to be easily adapted to ensure customization to the country context. The firm/consultant(s) will build on the institutional self-assessment tool developed by the National Agency for Quality Assurance in Professional Education. The Quality Assessment Tool includes focus groups with students (soon-to-graduates) and graduates and structured interviews with selected employers (the World Bank Group will provide guidelines and discussion points or a draft interview for the focus groups and structured interviews, respectively). The final version of the focus group discussion points and interview template will be agreed upon with the WBG and Ministry of Education; 
      (iii)	Implementation of the Quality Assessment Tool: Carry out the fieldwork according to the agreed Methodology Note applying the Quality Assessment tool. 
      (iv)	Prepare an implementation report: The firm/consultant(s) will produce a five page implementation report upon completion of the fieldwork. This report will constitute an institutional memory of how the data collection process unfolded (i.e. number of institutions visited, selected key informants, challenges in data collection and overall observations);
      (v)	Submit the Quality Assessment Tool data to the World Bank: For the data gathered through the questionnaire, the firm/consultant will submit the tabulated data files, data file key, and preliminary set of cross tabulations, all in Stata. For the data gathered through focus groups and structured interviews, the firm/consultant will submit verbatim transcripts in Word, SPSS or other qualitative data capturing system. The data files will be broken down by type of informant. A simple report with key cross tabulations will be submitted as a final deliverable;   
      (vi)	Complete the institutional briefs: Based on the data submitted by the firm/consultant(s), the World Bank will produce a ten-page country report summarizing the findings from the Mapping and Quality Assessment Tools. The World Bank will also create a template for the institutional briefs with a 2-3 completed briefs to serve as an example. The firm/consultant(s) will complete the remaining institutional briefs, one for each short term training provider that participated in the Quality Assessment phase. 
      
      Deliverables: 
      (i)	Completed mapping tool (inventory of short term training providers);
      (ii)	Brief landscape of training providers: short report (no more than 5 pages) describing and analyzing the countrys short term training provision landscape;
      (iii)	Five-page implementation report: including a description of how the data collection process took place;
      (iv)	Data files (for both quantitative and qualitative data) and simple report with key cross tabulations;
      (v)	Completed institutional briefs for each short term training provider that participated in the Quality Assessment phase.
