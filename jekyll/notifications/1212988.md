      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) is planning to launch an ambitious National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) which: (i) provides the current state of financial inclusion and a financial sector overview including delivery channels, services and products; (ii) indicates a vision for financial inclusion in Ethiopia; (iii) identify priority areas and outlines a framework for action;  (iv) identifies key targets for financial inclusion by 2020; (v) establishes a coordination and implementation mechanism; (vi) proposes a monitoring & evaluation system. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has been assigned by GoE as the lead institution for coordinating the financial inclusion agenda in Ethiopia. A Financial Inclusion Technical Secretariat (FITS), directly responsible for implementing the NFIS and coordinating any initiative related to financial inclusion in Ethiopia, has been established and it is housed at the NBE. The FITS is coordinated by a director who reports to the NBE Vice Governor for Financial Institutions Supervision.
      
      The Finance & Markets Global Practice of the World Bank Group has been given the mandate to manage the Financial Inclusion Support Framework (FISF), a Dutch-funded trust fund dedicated to support countries in implementing financial inclusion reforms and other measures to accelerate the achievement of national financial inclusion commitments and targets.  Under FISF, the World Bank Group has supported the Government of Ethiopia in its efforts to draft a National Financial Inclusion Strategy and has been requested to continue to provide technical and financial support through its implementation. The FISF program will provide technical assistance, advisory services, and capacity building for policy and regulatory reforms as well as financial infrastructure development, and other support measures in four main areas: (i) NFIS Coordination, Implementation and M&E; (ii) Financial infrastructure; (iii) Diversified Financial Services for Individuals and Enterprises; (iv) Financial Capability and Consumer Protection.  
      
      Under the first component of NFIS Coordination, Implementation and M&E, the FISF Ethiopia project will support targeted technical assistance to the NBEs Financial Inclusion Technical Secretariat (FITS)  to strategically plan, coordinate and evaluate the implementation of the NFIS. 
      
      The WBG is looking for a consultant to provide flexible, on-the-ground support to FITS at the NBE in implementing the NFIS through technical advice, capacity building, and resource mobilization.
      
      The assignment is expected to be full time and take up to 120 days, starting in March, 2016 and concluding on June 30th, 2016. A second contract will be provided contingent on performance for the remainder of the assignment from July 1st, 2016  December 31st, 2016.
