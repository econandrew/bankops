      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The consultant will:
      oIdentify an NTM through a careful reading of laws and regulations in order to extract any provisions that fall within the category of NTMs as described in the UNCTAD 2012 classification.  It should be remembered that NTMs may be effected not only by national level laws or ministry level regulations but also by local office notices or instructions to the public.
      oFurthermore, NTMs may come under the competency of many different government agencies or ministries which, from time to time, exercise some form of control over or somehow become involved in the import/export process e.g. to collect fees, etc.
      oOnce an NTM has been identified in the body of the legal text it should be entered, in the first instance, in a spreadsheet the format of which was determined by the World Bank and that is a common format agreed by a number of ASEAN members.
