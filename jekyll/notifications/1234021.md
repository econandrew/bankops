      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank is seeking the services of a firm to conduct an analysis of how to promote forest smart Large Scale Mining (LSM) in forest landscapes.
      the Objective of this study is to identify and analyze, by means of a series of Case studies on Large Scale Mining in Forest Landscapes; good and bad practices that feed into the overall study's objective and serve to identify conditions and mechanism for forest-smart LSM. 
      Outcomes:  Identification of good and bad practices and/or enabling conditions related to promoting Forest-Smart LSM based on a series of case studies.
      These are intended to inform policy recommendations for the World Bank and World Bank Clients on how to better facilitate/ promote 'Forest-smart mining.
      
      This work will be undertaken in two phases: 
      
      A first phase will include a literature review, general assessment, refinement of criteria and presentation of a short list of potential case studies and a detailed plan of action and methodology for phase two including an outline of the final report. This work will be presented in a discussion forum, to be identified, with the World Bank.
      
      A second phase will include in-depth analysis of case studies which presented to the World Bank and/or other parties for feedback which will be incorporated into a final report. This could include travel to a limited number of case study sites.
      
      
      BACKGROUND
      
      In its five-year Forest Action Plan, the World Bank prioritizes investments in sustainable forest management and forest-smart interventions that take a landscape approach and consider other sectors. The present program on Extractive Industries in Forest Landscapes fits into this vision that economic sectors do not erode forest capital and generate instead positive forest outcomes. The objective of the program is to enable client countries and the World Bank Group to make better-informed decisions about minimizing trade-offs and maximizing benefits from forest-smart mining. More specifically the program will generate knowledge on the Extractives-Forest Nexus, and how to translate this into forest-smart mining strategies and accompanying tools. 
      Forest-smart implies avoiding or minimizing potential adverse impacts on forests. Avoiding any impact can be targeted in landscape level planning of extractives development. Minimizing impact of mining may be pursued through mitigation or compensation measures or LSM and ASM activities. Supporting forest-smart interventions will not only ensure that adverse impacts on forests and their biodiversity are avoided or minimized, but also identify opportunities for increasing the productivity and resilience of other sectors. Minimizing threats involve: avoiding deforestation and degradation; reducing greenhouse gas emissions due to land use change; mitigating impact of droughts, floods and storms; regulating water and climate, and; protecting infrastructure. Forest-smart interventions are based on the aforementioned integrated landscape approach. The consultancy should take into account this concept of Forest-smart mining and answers to what it exactly means for LSM.
