      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      Assignment Title: 1237580 - Endline data collection for estimating the efficiency gains made through the integration of HIV and Reproductive Services in Zimbabwe
      Assignment Countries:
        - Zimbabwe
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      In Zimbabwe, the Government of Zimbabwe has prioritized integration of HIV and AIDS interventions into sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. The response is underpinned by a growing body of knowledge on the potential for efficiency gains from integrating HIV care into other services (e.g. Sexual Reproductive Health) at every level of the health care system. Within the context of rolling out a new national policy on HIV-SRH integration, the World Bank has been supporting the Government of Zimbabwe to undertake an impact evaluation aiming at assessing whether efficiency gains made when integrating HIV services into SRH services. The impact evaluation aims to answer the evaluation question: Does integrating HIV and SRH services reduce costs of service provision without compromising quality of patient care? The evaluation focuses on integration of HIV and SRH services at the primary health care level, district/mission, provincial and central hospital level within three different packages of service provision: integrating HIV services into 1) family planning and 2) antenatal care clinics, and 3) integrating SRH services into ART clinics.
      
      This evaluation is designed to assess the impact of the Government of Zimbabwes new integration strategy on the cost functions of service provision and the associated quality of patient care in Zimbabwe. Impact evaluation endpoints are changes in the integration index at each facility, changes in the total and average cost per service delivered, changes in the quality index at each facility changes in the cost functions of all services provided.
      
      Baseline data and supplementary data have been collected for 2013/2014, and an intervention has been implemented to stimulate integration in 50% of districts (randomly selected) where baseline data were collected, in 201 and 2017. 
      
      Within the context of the impact evaluation, endline data need to be collected using questionnaires that have already been developed in 192 health facilities (31 district hospitals and 148 PHCs). Data would need to be collected during the period 1 Oct to 31 Dec 2017 (all data collection needs to be completed before 31 Dec 17). Before that, the data platform needs to be programmed and the questionnaires pre-tested (July 17), enumerators trained and tested for competency (Aug 2017), and fieldwork preparations (Sept 2017).
