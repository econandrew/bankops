      The World Bank is seeking consultancy services to develop a Global Study on Water Supply and Sanitation Policies, Institutions, Regulation and Incentives. The primary objective of the study is to provide an in-depth analysis of the policies, institutional structures, regulation and financing mechanisms that, if addressed in an integrated manner, could provide an adequate set of incentives to achieve sustainable universal access to water and sanitation services (WSS).
      The scope of work of the assignment includes, but is not limited to the development of a conceptual framework, methodology and tools for the evidence based analysis of policies, institutions and incentives for the WSS sector. The proposed framework should be implementable in WSS sectors on a global scale and should cover analysis of regulation, financial instruments, decentralization, fiscal transfers, policy incentives, and the sector reforms.
