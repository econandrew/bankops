      The World Bank, through its Kenya Accountable Devolution Program (KADP)aims to strengthen and support the enabling environment for social accountability at the county level and improve the quality and responsiveness of devolved service delivery. Key amongst its objectives is to embed social accountability systems into devolved county structures in Kenya and share evidence-based knowledge on global and local findings, experiences and trends on decentralization, particularly transparency, accountability and participation with Kenyan policy makers, local government representatives and civil society leaders.
      
      While the current legal and policy framework is broadly enabling for social accountability, the challenge for counties is to translate these provisions into operational practice, working systems and capacities. Counties have made considerable progress in implementing the legal provisions by setting the requisite frameworks and structures for participation. However, progress is varied, as counties face challenges. 
      
      KADP will therefore address the above through the Kenya Participatory Budgeting Initiative. 
      
      The main aim of the consultancy will be to create awareness amongst the county citizens of the scope, process, entry points, and outcomes of the participatory budgeting process, to be achieved as per the attached ToRs.
