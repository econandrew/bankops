      I. Context:
      
      The World Bank Groups Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice (T&C) provides a comprehensive array of solutions to support the efforts of client governments to boost trade and investment, to improve productivity and competitiveness at the national and industry levels, and to create a better environment in general for business operations. Operating under T&C, the Climate Efficient Industries (CEI) initiative aims to enhance the competitiveness of manufacturing firms through climate-friendly resource efficiency measures. The initiative works with client governments to implement policies and processes that are beneficial to firms, the economy, and climate change mitigation. The main focus of the initiative is on creating an enabling environment with interventions for energy, water and waste efficiency related policy and regulations, standards and labeling, and financial mechanisms through strategic dialogue platforms that engage various stakeholders.
      
      The Government of Egypt (GoE) is one of T&Cs current clients. The country has committed to improving and promoting energy efficiency driven by the energy security risks associated with the pressures from growing population and rising fuel demand on its finite fossil fuel supply. This shortage of traditional fuels poses a serious challenge to the industrial growth of Egypt. The industrial sector energy demand amounts to approximately one third of final energy production. Yet energy efficiency within industries is not adequately exploited due to high energy subsidies, the lack of an effective policy framework, weak environmental law enforcement, and the lack of availability of clean technologies in the local market, among other factors. 
      
      Egypt has recently transformed the energy sector by issuing a PM Decree in 2014 increasing electricity tariffs and phasing-out subsidies by 2019. Accordingly, the Ministry of Trade & Industry (MoTI) is implementing an energy efficiency program to lower the energy security risks for industries and improve their international competitiveness while encouraging growth in green manufacturing and services. MoTI has requested World Bank Group assistance on developing the regulatory and institutional structure and regulatory framework to support activities on industrial energy efficiency and get them started on high impact initiatives on standards and labeling for industrial equipment. The program focuses on 2 components:
      
      1. Increase up-take of energy efficient electric motors by;
      	Developing minimum energy performance standards (MEPS),
      	Developing a labelling system for energy efficient motors,
      	Improving the monitoring verification & enforcement mechanism.
      
      2. Catalyze investment in energy efficient technology manufacturing and increasing their availability and use by industries by;
      	Improving policies and regulatory frameworks to encourage investment in energy efficient technology manufacturing,
      	Developing policies that support energy efficient technology use by industries.
      
      This assignment is a sub-set of component2.
      
      II. Objective:
      
      The World Bank Group Trade and Competitiveness global practice is working with the Government of Egypt (GoE) to lower the risks for its industries, posed by energy shortages and future increases in energy costs, and improve their competitiveness.
      
      This assignment aims to understand what stands in the way of increasing linkages between energy efficient motors manufacturers, and local suppliers, and developing a strategy and implementation plan for embedding suppliers into the clean technology manufacturing supply chain.  The approach to the assignment is to include other related clean technology products which could benefit from similar local suppliers thereby increasing the demand side of the value chain (i.e. motors used in white goods and other equipment to be identified through the assignment). . The final deliverable should articulate the market potential in the Egyptian market for private sector investment, provide detailed analysis of the manufacturing value chain in Egypt. 
      
      III. Scope of Work:
      
      a.	 Detailed Analysis of the energy efficient  electric motor value chain and identify other related end products (i.e. white goods, pumps) which could benefit from similar component inputs in Egypt 
      	The consultants should provide a detailed value chain assessment of the motor value chain and its components in Egypt. 
      	Based on the detailed assessment identify 1-2 other relevant products (i.e. white goods, pumps) which could benefit for similar components, inputs, or services. The end products would be identified based on an agreed upon criteria and demand potential.
      
      b.	Detailed analysis of the manufacturing value chain for energy efficient electric motors and related technology identified and the potential for local manufacturing capacity to supply potential demand.
      	Analyze and assess local manufacturing potential of the technology in Egypt including metrics such as but not limited to: labor availability/cost, resource availability/cost, manufacturing ability, component demand, cost factors, risks, innovation capacity, payback period and others to be determined.
      	Analysis should take into account technological/component maturity, competition, upstream availability/reliability/quality, local industry ability / interest to adapt local production to supply components, among others factors.
      	Analysis should include the motor rewinding / repair market, and ability for them to adapt their practices / services to participate in energy efficient motor components market. 
      	Identification of private sector leaders to develop the market (throughout the value chain).
      	Identify barriers to entry (i.e. access to skilled labor, technological complexity, capital intensity, etc.) for manufacturers / component manufacturers and possible actions to unlock barriers and develop the market. 
      	Estimation of benefits, income generation, job creation, skills development etc.
      
      c.	Develop and implement a demand / supply strategy and roadmap for the development of local manufacturing capacity of energy efficient electric motor and related technology in Egypt
      	Using a consultative process to validate findings, build consensus, and ensure stakeholder buy-in to develop a roadmap with key milestones and actions. Roadmap should identify key actions to be carried out by the private sector, government, and other relevant actors to unlock the market in the short and medium to long term.
      	Identify financing options and tools to enable uptake by customers, including those tools which are not currently available in Egypt.
      	Propose reforms / policy interventions catalyze investment, market growth, and address consumer up-take barriers.  
      
      
      Note: Firm/consortium should include local counterparts and expertise for regular follow-up and implementation support.
      
      IV. Deliverables and timeline: 
      Deliverables:
      	Sector demand requirements for key product clusters (i.e. electric motors and additional related technologies)
      	Sector supply capabilities for key product clusters and competitive benchmarking (i.e. electric motors and additional related technologies)
      	Gap analysis of demand and supply (i.e. electric motors and additional related technologies)
      	Demand-supply linkages strategy and roadmap 
      
      Timeline:
      The consultant contract will start March 15, 2017 and end est. September 30 2017. 
      
      Note: 
      The World Bank Group completed an analysis to identify energy efficient technology with growing demand in Egypt and local manufacturing and / or component manufacturing potential. From that analysis several technologies were identified of which this assignment looks to follow-up on in depth.  If firms would like access to this report, they must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
