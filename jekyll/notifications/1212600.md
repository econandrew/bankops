      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1212600 - CONSULTING SERVICES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-HAZARD RISK REDUCTION OPTIONS FOR METRO MANILA PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Philippines
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Philippines is increasingly exposed and vulnerable to natural hazards, which undermines poverty reduction and long-term growth. For instance, Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), which struck the country in 2013, is considered to be the strongest typhoon ever to make landfall causing over 6,200 reported fatalities and over 1,700 people missing. As a result of the disaster, an additional 2.3 million people were estimated to have fallen below the poverty line. The total damage and loss from this event was estimated at PHP 571.1 billion (equivalent to USD 12.9 billion) hampering economic growth by about 0.9 % in 2013, and another 0.3 % in 2014.  Catastrophe risk assessment for the Philippines  shows that losses of this magnitude have an annual occurrence likelihood of three percent. In other words, over any given 25-year period, there is an over 50 percent likelihood that such a loss would occur again. 
      Located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is particularly vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquakes, typhoons, floods, volcanic activity, and tsunamis. In addition to the risk of human life loss and suffering, it is estimated that 85% of the national GDP activity occurs in at-risk areas, such as Metro Manila, which further emphasizes the need for a robust natural hazards risk mitigation program. As such, it is vital to develop a multi-hazard evaluation and seismic risk reduction program for this important metropolitan area. The two key components of a successful program are: (1) building-specific vulnerability assessment, and (2) the development of appropriate risk reduction solution to optimize the use of available resources. 
      Key findings of previous analytical work assessing the portfolio of public facilities in Metro Manila indicate that, for typical public school buildings, earthquakes pose the greatest risk to public safety. This is in part due to the fact that, unlike other natural hazards, it is not possible to predict earthquakes and hence there are no options for early warning. Furthermore, because of the use of older seismic design codes or poor-quality detailing and/or construction, multistory reinforced concrete construction of the variety typically found in Metro Manila public schools is especially vulnerable to earthquake damage or collapse. 
      
      The objective of this assignment is to contribute to the Department of Educations (DepEd) initiative to mitigate disaster risk to public school buildings in Metro Manila.  The specific objectives of this assignment are to:
      a)	Conduct building-specific structural risk assessment of priority, high-risk school buildings in Metro Manila, including field training for DepEd engineers on risk assessment of school buildings; 
      b)	Based on the structural risk assessment, provide risk reduction (reconstruction/retrofit) options for assessed buildings, and the corresponding cost estimates; and 
      c)	Develop a multi-hazard decision-making methodology that is replicable and provides an algorithm to support DepEds selection of risk reduction options, e.g., retrofit, in-situ reconstruction, or relocation and reconstruction.
