      DIME is a global program in the Banks Research Group that carries out Impact Evaluations (IEs) to test innovations and find solutions to make policy work. As a bridge between research and development operations, DIME provides a substantial knowledge contribution by generating high-quality evidence across a set of strategic development areas. The IE Text Messaging for Behavior Change in Zambia is part of the DIME program and aims to use a novel text-messaging-based intervention to: 1) identify behavioral barriers that lead to low engagement with formal financial services amongst those using the services; and 2) test strategies to help people overcome those barriers to increase engagement and financial security. To implement this IE, DIME is seeking proposals for a technology partner to operate a two-way conversational text-message system to improve savings account usage and improve loan repayment rates for financial sector clients in Zambia.
