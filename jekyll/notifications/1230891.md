      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The underlying objective from study findings will be to provide the women (including children, senior citizens and the physically challenged) opportunity for greater participation and their empowerment as users of improved and safer mobility. Women participation in workforce in Assam is lower than the national average. The improved connectivity across and along the Brahmaputra should help in improving their access to employment opportunities, health, education and other social services, access to markets for local products and possibly development of new industries on riparian land. Another objective is to facilitate regional trade and markets. The study will therefore also make a detailed assessment of the soft (policy level) and hard (infrastructure) trade related aspects that can be advanced to draw advantages from development and modernization of the IWT sector in the state. The draft ToR for this assignment is attached.
