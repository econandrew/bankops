      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The objective of this study is to assess specific issues in Danube Basin region regarding: (i) implementation, (ii) outcomes; and (iii) sustainability (mostly from the point of view of affordability) of the UWWTD in the Danube Region. While the study will primarily base its assessment in the experience of current EU members countries within the Danube River Basin in the directive implementation, the work is expected to also benefit EU candidates and potential candidate countries from the region (meaning almost all other countries of the region). In this first stage, the study will not seek to answer all of those questions conclusively, but rather to provide sufficient elements needed to initiate an in depth discussion on achievement and appropriateness of UWWT directive implementation in DRB. In parallel, the study will also seek to document specific good practices that might show how to improve implementation efficiency.
