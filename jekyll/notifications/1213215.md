      The Ethiopia Investment Climate Program is designed to strengthen Ethiopia's capacity to create an enabling environment for private sector development by building the capacity of relevant government institutions to create and implement effective institutional frameworks and systems that support private sector development.  The program seeks to engage a consulting firm to undertake a Mid-Term Review (MTR).
      
      The MTR will provide an assessment of the program design, implementation progress and results accomplished towards intended targets to date. Review findings are expected to provide clear and comprehensive direction to the program team, clients and donors in taking mid-course correction, if needed and reconfirm interventions that are on track according to set targets. The MTR shall generate evidence against outcomes already accomplished, document lessons and identify future intervention opportunities emanated from the program.
      
      Scope of Work: 
      
      The MTR will be undertaken in light of the following:
      
       Track program implementation progress and accomplished results: The MTR will track implementation progress in relation to stated program objectives, focusing both on the program as a composite and its constituent projects. Focus shall be placed on stated deliverables and timelines, in the context of country context and evolving program reach. The MTR will collect verifiable evidences to support claimed results by the program.   
      
       Identify gaps and provide learning insights: The MTR shall map gaps in program implementation as related to stated objectives, and recommend clear and constructive measures for overcoming these bottlenecks in delivery. Recommendations should address themselves as measures for mid-course correction and program strengthening.
       
       Identify potential future intervention opportunities and refine strategic outlook: In the interests of further deepening engagement on individual projects, and to aid the design of future program activities, the MTR will identify future advisory and lending priorities emanating from Ethiopia IC. The MTR will develop a strategic roadmap for the close of the Ethiopia IC program, recommend regarding program exit and transition strategies.
