      Multi Donor Trust Fund for Justice Sector Support in Serbia (MDTF-JSS)
      Terms of Reference 
      Analyzing small claims processing in Serbian courts
       BACKGROUND
      The objective of the MDTF-JSS is to provide support for strengthening the justice sector of the Republic of Serbia in order to facilitate its integration to the European Union.  Established in 2009, the MDTF-JSS pools financial contributions from nine key international development partners and is jointly executed by the World Bank and the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). A key focus of the MDTF-JSS is to improve access to justice for citizens and small businesses.  
      In 2014, a key activity of the MDTF-JSS was the conduct of a Judicial Functional Review, which provided a comprehensive and objective assessment of the functioning of the Serbian judiciary with recommendations and next steps, for the purpose of informing the Chapter 23 accession process.  The Review highlighted that the courts offer few opportunities to fast-track the resolution of small claims cases, unlike most EU member states.  This causes excessive workloads for courts and frustration for court users, and limits access to justice, especially for poorer citizens and micro and small businesses.
      With that in mind, the MDTF-JSS has agreed to investigate how small claims could be fast-tracked in Serbia.
