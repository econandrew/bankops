      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1238185 - CGAP Voice of Customers: Strengthening the role of agents by using the customer care center
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Cambodia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      CGAP with AMK are conducting a Voice of Customer project to expand the role of AMKs call center to anchor interactions between them, their customers, and their agents. The project assumes that customers can easily become disconnected from unresponsive digital financial services, and by focusing on approaches that strengthen, listen, and respond to the voice of customers, providers ensure more customer-centric services.
      
      CGAP is seeking a firm that has expertise in customer research, identification of customer experience metrics, organizational process design, data analytics and creates dashboards.
      
      AMK, a microfinance institution in Cambodia, has qualitative data on the performance of agents, insights from previous research studies and gathers on-going information through calls received at the call center. The firm is expected to use existing insights and available data, identify the multiple channels of communication that are used by AMK employees, agents and customers, and find ways in which these can be integrated at the call center. In addition to identifying strong communication channels, the firm will create a dashboard that can be viewed by different business teams to take action, and the metrics reflected on the dashboard find their way into employee scorecards as KPIs. 
      
      CGAP aims to guide providers to better understand the economic and social lives and financial needs of poor people. Insights and results from this work will feed into the development of an interactive Guide to Customer Centricity as Business Model that CGAP is developing, which provides guidance, solutions and case studies for financial service providers wanting to enhance their understanding of customers and become more customer centric in their operations.
      
      The firm is expected to have past experience of working on similar or relevant projects and be able to provide concrete examples of action points resulting from these projects when they submit their proposal. Past experience of work with financial service providers catering to low income customers, work in Cambodia or other emerging markets will be an advantage.
