      IFC wishes to assess the economic cost and benefits of deploying energy efficient LED street lighting in Turkey, to identify and describe key international case studies of large-scale LED roll-outs and to develop and recommend a strategy and business model for a country-wide introduction of energy efficient LED street lighting in Turkey. The assignment will include inter alia the following tasks:
      	A high-level review of LED street lighting technologies and global benchmark cases of large-scale LED street lighting introductions
      	A review of existing operational and performance data of street lighting systems in Turkey
      	A high-level analysis of the costs and benefits of a country-wide replacement of existing street lighting systems with energy efficient LED technologies
      	A detailed analysis of representative international case studies of LED street lighting refurbishment programs, with a particular focus on employed financing and business models.
      	Development and recommendation of a suitable strategy for the roll-out of energy efficient LED street lighting in Turkey, including the identification of one or two pilot projects
      The results of tasks are expected to be delivered in one comprehensive or several separate reports in both English and Turkish. In addition, the consultant is expected to assist IFC in presenting the findings to the client and other relevant stakeholders (preferably in Turkish). 	
      Due to possible data gaps the review of existing operational and performance data may require data gathering efforts in Turkey in a sample selection of representative street lighting systems.
