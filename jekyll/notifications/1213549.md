      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1213549 - Support for quantitative tool development and delivery under the analytics function
      
      World Bank-GFDRR Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program:
      Support for quantitative tool development and delivery under the analytics function
      
      The analytics function of the World Bank-GFDRR Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Program (DRFIP) - a partnership of the World Banks Finance & Markets Global Practice and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) - provides tools and analysis to support the DRFIP in its efforts to help World Bank clients develop and implement strategies for the financial management of disaster losses. 
      
      The DRFIP analytics function produces a variety of quantitative outputs to help World Bank clients develop DRFI strategies. These include probabilistic financial disaster risk assessments to help clients to understand their financial risk arising from natural disasters; cost-benefit analyses of different types of financial instrument (e.g. reserve funds, credit options, insurance); quantitative support to financial instrument design; and technical pricing of financial products. The DRFIP analytics function applies expertise in actuarial and probabilistic catastrophe risk modelling, and economic analysis to deliver this support. Building on several years of successful client engagement with prototype DRFI tools and analyses, the DRFIP is now expanding and further developing the provision of analytics. 
      
      The World Bank-GFDRR DRFIP is seeking support from a suitably experienced and qualified technical firm in the development of quantitative tools to support decision-making in financial disaster risk management. This consultancy will leverage the existing portfolio of tools and methodologies developed by the DRFIP analytics function to create a next generation of tools that draw on current international best practice in user interface design, transparency and quality in coding, and probabilistic financial and actuarial analysis.
      
      This consultancy covers the production of four initial tools, as will be detailed in the Terms of Reference (ToR), with the potential for further work conditional on the needs of the DRFIP and the performance of the successful vendor under this ToR. The initial tools are each specific to a particular country, and will be tailored to the level of technical dialogue and data availability for that country. The tools will be developed to allow decision makers to understand the financial implications of different DRF strategies, as well as answer questions about financial instruments and define relevant policy options.  All tools will be provided in a format agreed at project outset in writing, but likely to be Microsoft Excel 2007 or later.
      
      The consultant will report to the World Bank-GFDRR DRFIP. This duration of this assignment is until August 31 2016.
      
      The World Bank now invites eligible consultants to indicate their interest in providing the services. The firm will be selected following the World Banks Guidelines: Selection and Use of Consultants by the World Bank for Operational Purposes. Minimum qualifications of the firm to be selected for the required assignment include:
