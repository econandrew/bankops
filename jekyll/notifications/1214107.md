      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1214107 - Context-appropriate approaches to service delivery in Afghanistan
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Afghanistan
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      As aid flows to Afghanistan are normalized over coming years, total public resources available for service delivery are expected to decline. Government faces important challenges in both maintaining service quality and coverage, and ensuring that gains in state legitimacy achieved through recent improvements in services are sustained or expanded. This work will inform efforts to improve service delivery in Afghanistan, taking account of the extent to which service delivery is deeply embedded within and shapes state- and local-level political settlements.
