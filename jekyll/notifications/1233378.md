      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      As a result of Beiruts steadily worsening congestion and the poor and unreliable state of public transport, the Lebanese Governments attention has focused on the introduction of organized, high quality, and reliable public mass transit which ultimately aims to increase the number of public transport users. The capital investment in the required infrastructure will be financed publicly, however, the system could be operated and maintained by private sector operators under a PPP modality. The objective of the assignment is to assess the various PPP options for operating and maintaining the BRT and feeder system, and possibly investing in rolling-stock and supporting systems of the BRT/feeders, to recommend a preferred business model (using a robust options appraisal model), and to outline the main legal, regulatory, financial, and cost and risk sharing aspects of that preferred model, seek market input on the model and prepare an outline structure.
