      ASSIGNMENT TITLE: 1235795 - Greece Investment Licensing Baseline Survey
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      In collaboration with the Government of Greece and the European Commission, the World Bank Group is implementing an Investment Licensing Reform Project in Greece. The objective of the project is help Greece achieve a simplified, transparent, and cost-effective business licensing regime in line with EU good practices. In the initial phase of the project, a survey will be undertaken to collect baseline data needed to underpin the reform.
      
      The survey is expected to cover both the administrative burden posed by licensing, and the quality of interactions between businesses and licensing and enforcement authorities. The data are expected to help identify the key issues for improvement and provide a model for future follow-up surveys to track improvements and the impact of the reforms.
      
      The survey is tentatively planned to be undertaken in two stages. The first stage would be a nationally representative survey of a substantial number of firms (tentatively 1000), covering all types of licenses, approvals and inspections, and all sectors, with the aim to capture aggregate burden, coverage, differences between sectors, and some key numbers on the most important approvals/inspections. Respondents should be top managers or owners of businesses most knowledgeable in the topics of the survey. The method for data collection should be face-to-face interviews, conducted with a paper-based or digital (tablet) questionnaire. The estimated duration of an interview would be roughly 30-40 minutes.
      
      The second stage would be more in-depth interviews on time and cost (following the Standard Cost Model methodology) on some higher profile licenses and inspections with a smaller number of respondents in priority sectors.
      
      The selected survey company would work with World Bank Group experts to finalize the survey instruments, field-test them, conduct the survey through face-to-face interviews with businesses, and present the full data and summary results.
