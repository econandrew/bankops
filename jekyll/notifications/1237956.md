      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank Group is seeking a vendor to provide an online web-based Private/Public Engagement Platform (referred hereafter as P3 Platform or Platform). This Platform will improve all aspects of private-sector development by acquiring information, sharing this information, encouraging private sector firms to participate, enhancing public-private dialogue in developing countries in the following ways:
      	Open source platform. This Platform shall be made public for other users to adapt it and use it in a different context;
      	Open data. This Platform will enable policy makers to get quick access to up-to-date information on firms, while keeping their individual identities confidential. On the other hand, this Platform will make available all the available analysis  directly based on the data collected on this Platform as well as other materials  and a personalized benchmark to respondent firms. 
      	Open collaboration. This platform will feature an interactive interface where the problem setting and the identification of solutions will be discussed. It will also support and facilitate the dissemination of the impacts that result from proposed solutions. 
      
      The Private/Public Engagement Platform (P3) shall have three pillars:
      (i)	Data collection.  The P3 Platform will reach out to firms, send them the link to respond to the questionnaire and store and clean the data collected from respondent firms. This dataset will be sent to the Project teams (GEM and WB) to produce sectoral analysis. This dataset will complement other market analysis and provide a better understanding of firm-level constraints, opportunities and dynamics;
      
      (ii)	Generating a demand for data collection. The more respondent firms, the more accurate the analysis. Different options are available to get a higher rate of participation: (a) The GEM project will share the sectoral analysis developed by the GEM project, (b) the P3 Platform will also provide a more micro-economic, personalized benchmark to the respondent firms based on information collected from them, and (c) the respondent firms may have preferential access to GEM support (technical assistance and/or grants). The pilot phase will provide information on the right level of support to respondent firms.
      
      (iii)	Space for discussion. The P3 Platform will provide space for firms to interact, share experience, discuss and design GEM intervention(s) and access information about their market segment. This part will take lessons from the participatory democracy platforms that ask citizens to participate.
