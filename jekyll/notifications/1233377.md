      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The project seeks to facilitate the gradual retrofitting/replacement of existing diesel generators for water pumping with solar power. The financing mechanism will consist of a blended financing approach where 50% of the investment in PVP by Community Owned Water Supply Organizations (COWSOs) will be covered by a grant and the remaining 50% covered through a loan from TIB Development Bank. COWSOs will repay the loan through monthly installments via a mobile money payment modality. COWSOs are generally unfamiliar with PVP technology and are not accustomed to receiving and servicing loans. For the Project to succeed, careful COWSO sensitization, training and follow-up is required.
