      The Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program (ASPP) was launched in March 2014 to increase access to effective adaptive social protection systems for poor and vulnerable populations in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. The program provides technical assistance and financing to develop, operationalize, and implement sustainable systems that will enable these countries to provide cost-effective adaptive social protection over the long term, andby directly expanding access to social assistance for the most vulnerableenable households to better withstand current and future shocks and invest in human capital development.

      The assignment will consist in gathering evidence on the effectiveness of livelihoods interventions in rural West Africa, designing a survey on constraints to productivity for poor households, carrying out data collection in several West-African countries, hiring and managing field staff based in several West-African countries to oversee program implementation and evaluation, and providing scientific guidance and oversight of the design and evaluation of the livelihoods package.
