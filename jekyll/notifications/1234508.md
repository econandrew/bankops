      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The International Finance Corporation (IFC) combines its financial products and technical solutions to support Chinese industrial sectors green growth and energy transition towards high portion of renewable energy consumption. IFC is seeking an experienced consulting firm (the Consultant) to undertake an analysis of the current regulatory enabling environment and market opportunities and barriers for implementing distributed renewable energy solutions (e.g., solar PV, bio-energy, wind, small hydro, and integrated hybrid forms, etc.) by commercial and industrial enterprises in selected industrial sectors (e.g. textile, consumer products, electronics, agri-business, etc.).
      
      IFCs interests in distributed renewable energy solutions stems from:
      1)	IFCs manufacturing sector clients who may wish to increase the use of renewable energy/alternative energy solutions in order to fulfill their corporate renewable energy commitments or sustainability goals for transition to carbon neutral supply chains  
      2)	Facilitating private sector investment in China for non-fossil-fuel based solutions that address climate change mitigation and reduce GHG emissions; and
      3)	Ultimately supporting green and low carbon energy transitions for industrial sectors in China  
      The Consultant is expected to conduct regulatory/ market study for distributed renewable energy solutions in China. The Consultants assignment is to assess and summarize viable technical and economical distributed renewable energy solutions at single/or multiple facilities (including those within industrial parks / economic development zones) in Chinas 13th Five Year Plan (FYP) period (2016-2020).  This study should be based on Chinas electricity market reform, renewable energy development goals, and other relevant factors.
