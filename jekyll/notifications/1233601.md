      Assignment Title: 1233601 - IFC Coordinator for Study on Local equity sharing schemes for hydropower projects in Nepal
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The hydropower potential of Nepal offers a unique opportunity for both economic and social development. In order to maximize these economic and social benefits and opportunities, the government of Nepal in consultation with the various stakeholders has provisioned for various benefit sharing mechanisms arising from the hydropower development. One key aspect of the Benefit Sharing mechanism focuses particularly on the practice of offering direct financial equity or shares to local populations affected by the development of hydropower projects. 
      
      The main objective of the consultants assignment is to oversee and guide the study of the delivery of Local Equity Sharing Schemes commonly referred to as Community Shares in Nepal, in the context of benefit sharing mechanisms applicable to hydropower projects. 
      
      A team of experts will be hired to conduct the study, however IFC is first hiring a Consultant to coordinate the study and oversee a team of experts to produce an in-depth study on the allocation mechanism and distribution of local shares.  
      
      The specific objectives of the study are to:
      1.Undertake a big picture desk review and an analysis of the available benefit sharing models/case studies (offerings from the past, present, and future projects) preferentially with respect to hydropower, but could draw from other infrastructure or extractive projects globally. It should aim to understand their strengths, weaknesses, risks and opportunities, as well as where would Community Shares fit in the overall Benefit Sharing landscape / mechanisms;
      
      2.Perform a detailed review of existing Community Shares examples in Nepal and elsewhere in the world, and provide a comparative analysis of the structures around and functions of the different Community Share models, the different modalities of offering shares locally, and the possible risks and rewards therein;
      
      3.Understand and assess the range of concerns, expectations and beliefs that exist around this issue from different stakeholders (project developers, investors, policymakers, and local concern groups, political parties, etc) as well as differences within these groups;
      
      4.Analyze the policy implications and dimensions of the implementation of Community Shares and the existing/ongoing judicial review process that is underway. Also to consider how existing policies relate to the Community Shares and how the work of different institutions relate to these issues and challenges. Suggest ways and means to align policy level issues with stakeholder expectations;
      
      5.Based on the above analysis, discuss where these current trends might be leading to in the future and the potential implications in terms of risks and challenges these trends may have for hydropower project development in Nepal.
      
      6.Propose and provide guidance on good practices for definition of eligibility criteria of Community Shares, as well as Delivery Mechanisms and Timing of this delivery. This guidance should clearly outline the appropriate stakeholder engagement process/ mechanism to assure that good practices include extensive consultation and engagement with all stakeholders/ think tanks and other relevant interested parties.
