      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Financial & Markets (F&M) Global Practice of The World Bank will employ the services of a specialized firm for the implementation of a face-to-face survey aimed at assessing among individuals the prevailing levels of financial capability and to capture information that will allow to strengthen the framework for the protection of the consumers of financial services in Haiti.  The survey will be carried out throughout Haiti.
      
      The implementation of these services includes the collection of appropriate frames for sampling, the estimation of samples and weights, the implementation of a pilot through 50  100 interviews and an appropriate translation of the questionnaire to the local language (Haitian Creole), the data collection process through the conduct of face-to-face interviews with households using a standard questionnaire that has already been developed by the World Bank, and the entry and quality control of the data. A sample of approximately 2500-3000 individuals will be randomly selected and surveyed.  Following the completion of the data analysis and submission of the final weighted dataset, the selected firm will be required to submit a final report stating any observations that have to be considered when analyzing the data. The project will follow the guidelines provided by the World Bank.
      
      The survey instrument captures information from individuals about their money management, financial planning, usage of and satisfaction with financial products, any related claims related to financial services as well as the experiences and outcomes achieved when presenting claims, financial capability levels, and sources of income and earnings. Each interview is expected to last approximately 60 minutes. It is expected that the (selected) firm will identify, train and hire local enumerators under the overall supervision of a limited number of its own staff.
      
      The F&M Global Practice now invites eligible firms to indicate their interest in conducting this survey in Haiti. Interested firms should provide information indicating that they are qualified to perform the services (brochures, description of similar assignments, experience in similar conditions, availability of appropriate skills among staff, capacity to implement and/or to coordinate household-level surveys).
