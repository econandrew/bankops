      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Since the beginning of the decentralization process in Niger, the local councils are assigned more and more responsibilities to manage public affairs. Since January, 27th 2016 the management of water and sanitation facilities are transferred to municipalities excluding those already managed by urban assets holding company (SPEN). Outsourcing the management of water facilities by the local councils to private operators in rural areas has now become the rule. The aim of the study is to strengthen local private operator capacity as well as the Government counterpart to manage fecal sludge using the potentials of the private sector. More especially, the study is expected to help: (i) update the business model and review proposed PPP options for sludge collection and treatment; (ii) strengthen the capacity of the city of Niamey as granting authority and as regulator for sludge management; (iii) strengthen the capacity of the local private sector to participate in the sludge management business and to provide services according to the improved regulatory and management framework; and  (iv) public relations and communications program to consumers and stakeholders to support the strategy
      The consultant will work in close collaboration with all actors involved in the fecal sludge management for the city of Niamey. The consultant will be available to the multi-sectoral steering committee organized for the purpose of this activity to advice the group.
