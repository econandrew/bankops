      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on promoting the role of private sector in developing countries. One area of growing demand for support from developing countries is in relation to the question of how to best leverage FDI for broader economic development. In particular what specific policies and programs can a country put in place that will help better link foreign investors with domestic companies and help local firms and SME's integrate better into the global economy through these backward linkages/supplier relationships.  
      
      In this context IFC is seeking the services of experienced Short Term Consultants to assist with the scoping, design and delivery of a variety of linkages programs in developing countries. In particular experts with deep experience around the design and implementation of overall linkages programs, demand-supply gap analysis, supplier development programs, supplier databases, matchmaking services, linkages enabling policy environment, incentives and regulations as well as institutional capacity building around linkages programs, are encouraged to submit an EOI. The IFC is looking for linkages program expertise across different sectors. In particular in relation to export manufacturing sectors (e.g. apparel, electronics, automotive, consumer goods), but also experts with strong experience around extractives sectors, food & beverages/agro-processing sectors and tourism sector linkages programs are encouraged to apply.
