      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION AND QUALIFICATIONS
      
      The second wave of SHFS aims to collect socio-economic data at the household-level representative of the Somali population, including urban, rural, IDPs and nomads. Interviews will be carried out using advanced CAPI. In addition to implementing the field work of the survey, the assignment involves support in the preparation of the sample frame including demarcation of enumeration areas, real-time quality control of data collection and integration of data-processing code into an existing Stata code pipeline. The implementation also aims to enhance statistical capacity of the involved Somali statistical authorities. 
      
      The assignment requires the following qualifications proven in previous assignments:
      
      -	Ability to implement representative CAPI household surveys in Somalia.
      -	Ability to generate algorithmically non-overlapping enumeration area maps based on GPS midpoints and satellite imagery. 
      -	Ability to monitor data collection in real-time by the generation of automated dashboards, implemented in a conflict environment.
      -	Ability to write and integrate data-processing code into complex code pipelines.
      -	Experience in building capacity for Somali authorities, ideally statistical authorities.
      
      Firms are required to describe specific past activities for each of those criteria and explain how they meet the qualifications. Firms are encouraged to provide (anonymized) materials from past assignments, e.g. for the generation of enumeration area maps, real-time monitoring dashboards and integrated data processing code.
