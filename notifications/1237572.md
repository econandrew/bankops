      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      Technical and Analytical Energy Advisory Services: Conducting a Model of Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) Survey and Analysis of Consumption Patterns in Kenya
      Assignment Countries: Kenya
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      Kenya has announced an ambitious target of achieving 70% access by 2017 and universal access to electricity by 2020, with due consideration to enhancing shared prosperity, and not leaving behind traditionally underserved rural populations. While access to electricity service in Kenya has increased rapidly from 23 percent in 2009 to an estimated 50 percent today - exceeding the average rate of access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa of 35 percent - meeting coverage targets in an efficient and effective manner and within the time frame set by the Government of Kenya (GOK) requires systematic planning for generation and transmission capacity expansion, grid densification and extension, and off-grid electrification.
      
      As such, Kenyas Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP) is updated annually by a technical committee of the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum (MoEP). This activity consists of a load forecast, generation optimizations and transmission simulations for the medium to long term. While various tools have been used to undertake each of these tasks, the committee has been incapacitated by lack of primary data in the format that would make it accurate and reliable, particularly on load forecasting.
      
      In view of the overriding influence demand forecasts have on the output of the planning process of the power industry, including the least-cost geospatial electrification plan and the LCPDP, it is considered imperative to invest in the development of credible and reliable demand forecast datasets in order to generate dependable demand forecast results for sector planning throughout the country  covering both grid and off-grid areas.
      
      The main objectives of the proposed assignment are to undertake a survey among households,  industrial, and commercial consumers and collect MAED specific data; and to assess the current energy consumption patterns of households and the commercial/industrial sectors in Kenya in order to have useful primary data for policy and regulatory decision-making.
      
      The World Bank, with support from the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), is seeking to hire a consulting firm (the Consultant) to assist GOK in conducting a Model of Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) Survey and in the preparation of a comprehensive study and analysis of consumption patterns in Kenya.
