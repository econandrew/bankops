      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1233751 - Development of a set of financial sector performance monitoring indicators for Russia
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Russian Federation
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Europe and Central Asia countries facing challenges on monitoring the impact of financial sector reforms. While a number of international agencies and institutions compile periodically their own set of indicators and ratings on financial sector topics worldwide, they generally focus on the banking sector, and tend to neglect the non-bank financial sector, such as capital markets, insurance, pensions, and microfinance organizations. 
      
      The purpose of this research is therefore to build a standardized monitoring system (including a survey) to provide the GP F&M with a tool to support its clients globally in monitoring both the bank and non-bank sector comprehensively. This shall be done with the specific case of Russia, as to ensure applicability, and client feedback during the testing of the standard set. 
      
      In particular, the project requires knowledge of the survey and quantitative methodology of World Economic Forum (WEF) indices in the context of Russian markets. The project is expected to be completed in 46 weeks.
