      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1234999 - Assessment of opportunities for the energy use of agricultural biomass in Sub-Saharan Africa
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries. Resource efficiency, clean energy and climate change are some of the strategic focus areas of IFC and its Energy and Resource Efficiency (E&RE) advisory group.
      
      In the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region, E&RE team works with companies as well as sector-level aggregators to catalyze the uptake and use of resource efficiency and clean energy solutions that will help reduce the use of energy, water as well as other resources, leading to greenhouse gases (GHG) emission reduction.
      
      The team is seeking to partner with a consulting firm to assess the potential of using agricultural biomass to generate power and heat in agricultural production clusters in up to three selected countries in SSA. The Assessment will seek to: i) identify key industry players and clusters within priority countries, their energy consumption, produce output and the size of the energy demand gap; ii) the types, quantities, uses and calorific value of available (and forecasted) biomass, and; iii) the technologies that can be used to convert biomass into energy and the feasibility thereof, as well as the costs associated with these technologies. 
      
      The Assessment will evaluate the current levels of energy consumption, produce output and available biomass against forecasted levels and amounts in 2025.  Based on these and other considerations, possible solutions and best practices for these agricultural clusters will be identified and presented.
