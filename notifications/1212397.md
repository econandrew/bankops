      About the Gateway Academy 
      Staff capacity at financial service providers (FSPs) has long been a challenge for financial inclusion efforts. Without strong staff, FSPs are limited in their ability to innovate and extend their outreach to the nearly 2.5 billion people who are excluded from the formal financial system. New applications of technology are bringing about massive change in the field of professional development and training. These approaches have the potential to dramatically expand the accessibility of high-quality content at a lower cost than traditional training models and thus boost much-needed capacity in the sector.
      Gateway Academy is an innovative learning project that will offer both on-line and blended courses and cultivate communities focused on financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Gateway Academy will work with training providers, financial service providers and on-line learning experts to generate high-quality course content, build communities of practice and conduct on-going research to understand user needs. 
      Gateway Academy is building on the reputation of the Microfinance Gateway (the Gateway) to support innovative approaches to build capacity of financial inclusion professionals. With fifteen years experience promoting knowledge exchange and professional development for the microfinance and inclusive finance sector, the Gateway is a trusted resource and the Gateway Academy is a natural extension of this strong foundation. 
      To build on this foundation, Gateway Academy is intended to: 
      	Create a transformative impact on financial inclusion by increasing the reach of high-quality training content; 
      	Capture a significant audience by offering a solution that meets the audiences needs in terms of user experience- e.g. the technical aspect of the platform are adapted to the target audiences environment;
      	Create lasting impact for those working to advance financial inclusion.
      
      We expect to see a significant number of users engaging in on-line learning and communities, gaining skills that are relevant to their jobs and helping them advance in their careers. 
      Consistent with CGAPs approach of creating demonstration projects and facilitating market development, CGAP will rapidly prototype and alpha-test options for delivering on-line learning testing format, content, delivery channels, incentives, constraints and other factors. Gateway Academy will begin to engage in this alpha testing before a course or a site is built and before the pilot and beta stages. This testing will continue throughout the life of the project. 
      
      Role	: Duties, Accountabilities, and Deliverables 
      The firm will work with the Gateway Academy Team on the following: 
      1.	Facilitate the development of a learning agenda for the Gateway Academy within 30 days of the award of the contract. This will encompass: 
      	Deep dive into the project and the projects objectives.
      	Development of thorough knowledge of the Academy.
      	A facilitated retreat/workshop with project team and major stakeholders to determine the MEL needs at multiple levels and how it can be extensible over time.
      	Co-developing appropriate questions to be approached throughout the various stages of the project and tested/researched through implementation.
      2.	Propose a monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) plan that incorporates the learning agenda within 60 days. This will include: 
      	A monitoring, evaluation and learning plan for one year that is extensible for the life of the project. It should include a plan for baseline data collection, both qualitative and quantitative. Note that learning questions in the beginning of the project will likely look at modes/methods, audience and content. 
      	Feedback loops and continuous learning should be part of the plan and built into project activities. The team is open to new and different methods including developmental evaluation.
      3.	Once the proposed learning plan is agreed on by the TTL, the firm will support the implementation the monitoring evaluation and learning plan. This will include:
      	Working with partners, the platform and other aspects of the project to monitor, collect data, analyze data and evaluate. 
      	Co-facilitating (with the Academy Team) learning events such as the annual learning workshop with partners. (It will not include logistics and other event management.)
      	Ensure that the learning agenda and Monitoring Evaluation and Learning (MEL) plan take into consideration the MasterCard Foundation (MCF) learning strategy. http://www.mastercardfdn.org/learn/
      
      The learning events will serve dual functions to both disseminate project lessons and examine the broader environment of training and capacity building. In addition to the programmatic component of these workshops, we will also use the opportunity to convene a broader group around training and capacity building. This will bring together other interested parties, including human resource professionals, speakers to discuss innovations in e-learning and m-learning, other training service providers not directly involved with the e-learning platform.
      
      The objective is to obtain insights from the monitoring which will regularly inform the programs design and approach and also to design a strongly results-oriented initiative, where it will be critical to capture outcomes, benefits and learnings primarily for CGAPs use. The secondary audience will be MCF and broader dissemination. A rigorous learning agenda and MEL methodology will be the basis of achieving this objective, including:
      
      	Clearly identified outputs (deliverables), outcomes (resulting shifts) and impact (goals);
      	Strong MEL framework for evaluating learning programs including indicators, baselines, data collection methods, sources, frequency of reporting, defining measures of effectiveness, performance and impact;
      	A robust method for tracking data in place before the programs are rolled-out to allow comparisons pre  post action; staggered rollout to allow leveraging ongoing learnings.
      
      Quantitative and qualitative monitoring will be ongoing and will be based on data from a number of sources that could include site analytics and usage data, surveys of users, higher management of FSPs and training providers. Together, the data will provide insights into participant performance and learning approaches as well as user satisfaction with the platform and its content and tools. In addition to regular monitoring, the program will conduct an annual evaluation to analyze the programs outcome on financial service providers staff skills and the potential impact on financial service providers themselves. 
      
      Qualifications/Experience
       The MEL team must be comprised of qualified experts in monitoring, evaluation and learning, with a demonstrated track record. 
      	It is expected that at least one member of the team have specific qualifications or credentials in e-Learning or knowledge management evaluation.
      	It is expected that at least one member of the team have specific qualifications or credentials in developing learning agendas, survey development, administration of interviews and workshops. 
      	It is expected that the team possess technical knowledge of training, knowledge management and/or online learning with reference to developing countries, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. 
      	It is expected that team have significant experience in cross country multilingual survey and qualitative research design, validation, data collection and analysis.
      	The evaluators must be strong communicators, in both written and oral English, with ability to adapt style to suit a diverse mix of stakeholders. 
      	We encourage bids that include local staff from Sub-Saharan Africa in their proposals. 
      	References and examples of past work are required and should be included in the proposal.
