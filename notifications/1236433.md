      ii.	Target use of loans including use of loans for Housing purposes.  Practical experience of credit officers with loans used for home improvement purposes even if the official purpose of the loan was different (types of home improvements financed, size/terms of the loans, NPLs, etc.). Demand from the clients for housing loans. 
      iii.	Experience of FIs with initiation of lending products combined with non-financial services, that require special training of staff and promotion 
      iv.	Willingness of FIs to invest in product development, staff training, product promotion, integration of software and other activities necessary to introduce the HMF product to the market. 
      v.	Implementation by the FIs of lending programs (current, and expected) that stimulate borrowers through grants, free TA or reduced interest rate.  Purposes of the program, conditions of the loans, volume of operations, results. 
      c.	Assess the interest and capacity of clients of FIs to borrow for home improvement purposes. The assessment is going to be conducted through distributing questionnaires to the current clients of FIs (preferably while they visit the FIs offices for enquires or for making payments). The questionnaire form is to be approved by the WB group.  The survey should cover all regions of the country with the specific emphasis on the GBAO.  At least 300 clients of FIs are to be interviewed. The following topics are to be covered by the survey:

      iii. Home improvements borrowers consider necessary to conduct. 
      iv. Willingness to borrow for home improvement and feasible size / term of the loan under the current interest rates of the FI (acceptable size of monthly home improvement loan repayment for the borrower).  
      v. Types of fuel used for heating and fuel (energy) consumption during the winter months. 
      vi. Methods used by households to save energy (the whole family stays in one room through the winter, the windows are covered with plastic, heating the room only in the evening when all family members come from school/work, etc.).
      vii. Willingness to conduct Energy Efficiency (EE) -- reducing energy consumption -- home improvements. 
      viii. Level of understanding of the savings that can be reached through EE home improvements. 
      ix. Level of knowledge about Solar Water Heating (SWH) technologies and understanding of savings and independence from energy supply that can be reached through the use of SWHs.  
      x. Share of the clients interested to conduct home improvements on do-it-yourself basis under condition that training and advice are provided. 
      xi. Extent to which individual houses are protected against natural disasters such as earthquakes, mud slides, floods, etc including both traditional forms (for example sinj (synchevie) houses for seismic protection), and required by the current building code (for example vertical and horizontal reinforced concrete beams for seismic protection, etc. 
      xii. Level of knowledge about natural disaster protection of houses that can be implemented by low and middle-income individual households in Tajikistan (earthquake protection, slide protection, etc.) and willingness to implement these measures.   
      
      
      2.Consultant should analyze all similar existing projects in Tajikistan funded by various donors (KfW, ADB Oxus, GIZ) and outline their goals, forms of cooperation with FIs (provision of TA, liquidity, grants, etc), FIs involved, to identify potential overlap with HMF lending product.
