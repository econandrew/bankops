      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1231926 - Assistance to BCFI to develop GRM for BC/Agent Banking Sector
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - India
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Agent networks in India play a critical role in promoting financial access, by helping financial service providers reach out to under banked areas. In the wake of recent financial inclusion initiatives by Government of India and other stakeholders, there has been a rapid growth in agent networks, with greater focus on building the infrastructure and increasing access points.
      In the coming days, viability of agent banking would depend on the quality of services provided (irrespective of the location, product or agent model). In order to have a sustainable agent network, the client must be able to trust the system/agents and conduct transactions with confidence. Indeed various researches  have shown that strong customer service and client protection practices are linked to profitability for both agents and agent network managers.
      
      Mechanisms like dedicated call center lines for BC agents and end-customers, display of banks customer care details at BC outlets, regular monitoring of BC agents by network managers etc. have been implemented by the service providers to address customer complaints. However, findings from the field  indicate that these procedures are often insufficiently robust and inconsistently applied across geographies, by service providers and banks. With financial transactions becoming interoperable through Aadhaar for all banks at a BC Agents location, challenges like agents and customers low awareness on existing grievance mechanisms, customers high dependency on agents for transactions and limited resources deployed at banks to address client complaints (mainly for their own customers and not for other customers), further lead to ineffective grievance redressal mechanisms in the field. This leads to isolation of banking transactions at BC locations, restricted to principal bank mainly and that too with inadequate customer grievance redressal processes. There is a need for devising effective grievance mechanisms that provide direct access to customers to lodge complaints and capacitate agents/ network managers to deliver the same.
      
      Recognizing these challenges, Business Correspondent Federation of India (BCFI) is working with key stakeholders to address these issues and enable customers to have access to responsible formal financial services. 
      
      In this background, IFC in partnership with BCFI, supported by DFID and SIDBI is hiring a consultant/firm to assist BCFI in developing a standardized, robust and effective GRM framework, to be implemented across various BC models. The consultant should focus on:
      
       - Review of existing GRMs in the industry and its effectiveness in resolving customer complaints.
       - Mapping of stakeholders and their associated roles and responsibilities 
       - Provide clear classification of complaints/issues (existing and potential) faced by customers
       - Incorporate customer facing mobile technologies like mobile apps using mobile data or USSD based services to bring reduced dependence on only manual interface of BC Agent and bring-in standardized complaint number system to make it customer friendly and make it scalable.
       - Define escalation matrix for each type of complaint and turn-around time (TAT) for its resolution
       - Agree with Banks on recourse of customer grievances for not meeting TAT
       - Identify mechanisms (like service feedback calls, customer surveys, mystery shopping exercises etc, but not limited to) to proactively collect complaints and feedback from customers.
       - Technology supported systems/process in the backend (compatible with various BC models) for effective capturing and monitoring of client complaints.
       - Analytical and reporting framework that provides BCFI with a comprehensive picture on usage and effectiveness of the designed GRM.
      -ToT module for the capacity building of network managers and agents in implementing the framework.
      - Measures to improve awareness among customers on GRM.
