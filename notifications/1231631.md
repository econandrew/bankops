      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Within CGAP, the Digital Finance Plus (DF+) agenda focuses on leveraging digital payment systems to bring essential energy, water, and educational services to the poor. Here finance is not an end itself but a means to help solve significant development challenges and improve the lives of the poor. 
      This project will examine the demand-side dynamics of pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) solar, where a customer acquires a solar home system (SHS) through a rent-to-own or perpetual leasing arrangement, then purchases days of prepaid energy via mobile money or airtime, often on a flexible basis. By using digital finance systems to outsource cash payments, these providers  known as distributed energy service companies, or DESCOs  have developed scalable business models that are premised on their ability to collect thousands (soon millions) of small, digital payments. 
      And yet there are significant gaps in our understanding of how PAYGo actually works for end customers.
