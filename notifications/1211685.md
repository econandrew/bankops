      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      Context and background:
      Centre for Financial Reporting Reform (CFRR) of the World Bank is implementing a major regional TA program, STAREP . Strengthening Auditing and Reporting in the Countries of the Eastern Partnership (STAREP) is a regional program aimed at creating a transparent policy environment and effective institutional framework for corporate reporting within the countries that make up the EUs Eastern Partnership: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. STAREP builds on the analysis and recommendations of the A&A ROSC program. STAREPs Component 5 Country-level Implementation Support provides valuable complementarity to country-specific initiatives. Tailored to individual country needs activities include providing help desk and ad-hoc advisory services to Governments, advice and support in developing national activities, as well as implementation support and complementary activities to ongoing national projects. 
      
      The World Bank 2013 A&AROSC update  report concluded that even if there has been significant progress during the last years to improve the statutory framework for accounting and auditing, implementation and enforcement of these reforms has been hampered by major capacity and resource constraints.

According to the provisions of the signed MD-EU Association Agreement the EU acquis communautaire in the area of corporate financial reporting should be transposed and enforced by September 1, 2017.
      
      CFRR intends to engage a STC to support the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in transposing the provisions of the EU acquis communautaire in the field of corporate financial reporting in the national law, and to assist the MOF in the process of coordinating the draft Law on Accounting to be presented to the Government and Parliament.
