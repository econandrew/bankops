      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The overall objective of South Caucasus Gender Assessment is to strengthen government and Bank teams knowledge and capacity for designing gender-informed policies that promote equity and help reduce poverty in Georgia. The Project focuses on female entrepreneurship in Georgia through assessing constraints to womens participation in priority value chains. 
      
      The Project aims to improve women entrepreneurs market access and competitiveness by assessing the constraints to participation of women in one priority value chain, particularly in the higher value added segments of the chain.
      
      The Project intends to hire firm to undertake the work outlined below: 
      1.	Value Chain Selection: Selecting a value chain or sub-sector on superficial observation basis bears the risk of choosing a sector with little potential for either upgrading or achieving gender objectives. This assessment will assist in selecting value chain, which has a potential to contribute to increased women empowerment and gender equality.
      2.	Value Chain Analysis: the objective of this assessment is to make women visible in a value chain. The focus will be on a global gender-sensitive picture of the value chain, the actors involved, their linkages and the percentages of men and women in each chain segment. It will assist in identifying constraints and opportunities for women to participate in the value chain, to analyze the differences in power (positions) in the value chain governance, and to discover opportunities for women to upgrade their position.
      
      These assessments shall serve as analytical background that will inform and shape future project interventions. To this end, the objectives are as follows:
      	Value chain selection: comparing around 3 priority sectors VCs and selecting the best VC relevant to the Project. 
      	Value chain analysis: data collection for value chain analysis at different levels; gender-sensitive value chain mapping; and gender-based constraints and opportunities detailed analysis.
