      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1213414 - Pre-feasibility Design Review for a Phased Rehabilitation & Extension of Monrovias Sewerage System
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Liberia
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The rehabilitation and expansion of piped sanitation systems in urban areas has been identified as a key priority in the Government of Liberia's Sector Investment Plan.
      
      Large sections of Liberias population are dangerously exposed to unsafe sanitation. Total improved sanitation remains below 17% and almost half of the population practice open defecation. In the capital Monrovia, less than 3% use a toilet facility connected to the sewer system compared to over 10% practicing open defecation in the city.
      
      An off-site piped sewerage system and treatment plant was constructed in Monrovia in the 1950s and 1960s, covering an area of approximately 27 square kilometers,  less than 20% of the Greater Monrovia urban area. In the original design, sewage from these areas was transmitted through a total of 64 kilometers of pipes to the Fiamah Sewage Treatment plant, which had an original capacity of 6 million gallons per day. Decades of neglect during and after the civil war have destroyed most of the piped sewage system of Monrovia, including all pumping stations and the Fiamah treatment plant. In some limited areas, gravity-driven sewage pipes are still operational, carrying waste-water to the dysfunctional Fiamah treatment plant from which it is then discharged into Mesurado River through a sludge lagoon.   
      
      This consultancy will have three main objectives: 
      
      (a) Update the information about the current piped sewerage system and treatment plant, as well as estimate the demand and willingness to pay for piped sewerage in Monrovia;
      
      (b)Carry out an engineering assessment of the technical options and associated costs for a phased rehabilitation and extension of Monrovias piped sewerage system, and recommend an approach;
      
      (c) For the recommended approach, prepare a detailed design and costing including draft safeguard and tender documentation;
