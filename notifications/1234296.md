      The primary objective of the Research for Results (R4R) program is to generate new evidence on student and teacher performance across school types and to create policy recommendations to strengthen the efficiency and quality of education services by public, private and non-state providers. Furthermore, the research program includes system-level analyses and stakeholder outreach to create and share new information about education services for uptake by policy makers and system stakeholders. The R4R program is governed by a Steering Committee, chaired by MEHE, and a Technical Committee, chaired by the Center for Educational Research and Development (CERD), and is financed by the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) and United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Under the R4R program different studies are designed to understand the causes and factors associated with the variation at all type of schools, public or private, in order to support the government initiatives to ensure learning for all children in Lebanon. One of these studies is looking into the school enabling environment covering four dimensions: school finances, school management and leadership, teachers, and school physical and learning environment. Other ongoing studies are focusing on student learning outcomes as well as teacher observation and classroom practices.   
      
      In response to the Syrian crisis, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education is expanding the scope of the R4R program to generating new evidence specifically in the areas of student persistence, dropout, community engagement, and measuring learning for school-aged vulnerable Lebanese and Syrians. A rich base of evidence will be gathered through data collection across different community types, school types, and school shifts in Lebanon. In this study, panel data will be collected on a sample of vulnerable students and out-of-school children to better understand the factors associated with persistence, risk factors for dropout, and ways schools and communities are supporting children to stay in school and learn.
