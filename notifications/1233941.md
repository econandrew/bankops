      A.	ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Lighting Asia/India program has been undertaking various activities since 2012 working to remove market barriers to adoption of quality assured products, through a series of market interventions. The program works with manufacturers and distributors of quality assured solar lighting appliances, to help them develop a robust footprint in underserved markets in India. Over the next 3 years, the program will scale up energy access by deepening its existing level of work and intervention in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, undertaking targeted activities in Rajasthan, and expanding market development activities into low income states that have not yet benefited from these products (Odisha and Assam).  It will also leverage other IFC Lighting programs (Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and PNG) to help Indian companies access international markets.
      
      B. SCOPE OF WORK:
      
      The objective of the project is to create an easy to use ready reckoner to support companies wishing to import quality assured pico-pv and SHS solar products into India. The output should enable companies to understand key requirements (including gauging HS codes under which their products fall), and highlight steps that a company should take to begin importing.    
      Product scope: The ready reckoner will cover pico-pv products and solar home systems as defined on ww.lightingglobal.org. Examples of quality assured products can be found at https://www.lightingglobal.org/products/?view=grid. The product scope should also include the import of DC solar appliances such as TVs and Fans.  
      Geographic scope: The ready reckoner should cover all applicable central import duty and taxes. The document should initially also cover relevant state level taxes for the following states: The eight states comprising the North East; Bihar; Odisha; Rajasthan; and Uttar Pradesh. 
      The scope may extend out to all other states depending on need and consultant performance. 
      
      C. Approach
