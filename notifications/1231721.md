        - East Africa Region
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
       Cross-Border Payments in East Africa  							
      
      Cross-border payments in East Africa comprise a significant and growing part of regional GDP.  Agriculture related cross-border transactions alone surpass 60 million transactions and USD 900 million in the region annually. USAID estimates that 95% these transactions are made through the physical exchange of cash.  The total size of the informal payments sector in the region remains unknown. However, the types of solutions available for cross-border transactions are becoming more varied. Person to Person (P2P) remittances through digital financial services already account for USD 1.3 billion per year within East Africa.     
      
      GSMA reports a 52% increase in the global volume of cross-border payments over mobile money in 2015.  This makes cross-border services the fastest growing mobile money product. The number of mobile-enabled pathways available for completing these transactions is also increasing. As of December 2015, 29 cross-border remittance corridors connect 19 countries. Over one-third of these corridors exist with or between countries in East Africa.
       
      CGAP seeks to better understand the cross-border payments ecosystem within East Africa  how payments are made today and how consumers would like to see them made in the future. It does this with the goal of further easing payments across borders and ultimately increasing financial inclusion within these markets.
       Scope of Work											
      
      The objective of this study is to understand whether demand exists for the use of digital financial services (DFS) in cross-border payments, the needs and wants of users engaging in these transactions, and the price elasticity for relevant services. DFS in this case includes mobile money services (e.g. M-Pesa) and linked bank-mobile money wallet accounts (e.g. NMB and M-Pesa linked accounts). Cross-border payments include those associated with sending or receiving funds across borders, performing cash-in/cash-out, and transacting with merchants, employers, and other institutions across national borders. 
      The objective of this project is to design and conduct in-depth market research across East Africa through a combination of field surveys, in-depth interviews and focus groups. The sample used for analysis must achieve adequate scale to provide insights from across a diverse population, including gender, income, region, and other relevant dimensions. Field work and deliverables should include: coverage of Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda; or a subset of these countries as defined within the final service agreement. The market research should cover users (individuals and organizations) of mobile money or DFS, agents who deliver services on behalf of DFS providers, as well as non-users who share characteristics with current users. It should not cover other stakeholders such as donors or third party payment service providers who may be involved in DFS, but do not directly use, engage in or support transactions across borders. PLEASE SEE THE DETAILED TOR ATTACHED AND RESPOND TO THE EOI.
