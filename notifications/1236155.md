      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1236155 - Climate change impacts on the transport sector on Lake Victoria and mitigation strategies
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Tanzania
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      There is considerable potential for the growth of shipping services on Lake Victoria, provided that the ports and transport corridors around the lake are rehabilitated. However Lake Victoria is a very shallow lake and 80% of its water comes from rainfall, which makes lake levels very sensitive to changes in weather patterns. In addition, low lake levels favor the growth of invasive species that can disrupt port access. Before designing investments for ports rehabilitation, the World Bank would like to investigate the potential impacts of lake level fluctuation now and under future climate change on transport services.
      
      The proposed study will investigate the risks created by lake level fluctuation now and under climate change for transport on and around Lake Victoria, and identify solutions to reduce these risks. It will answer the following questions: how would different lake water-level scenarios (e.g., overall increase, overall decrease, and status quo. and associated variation range) impact transport operations (port infrastructure and operations and access roads) given different scenarios on shipping demand growth? What could be good investment strategies given that we cannot predict future lake level fluctuation or transport demand on the lake?
      
      Because there exist multiple futures for climate change impacts on the lake and transport demand growth, the consultants will be asked to explore the performance of several investment and operation strategies in alternative future states of the world. The probability of those alternative futures being unknown, we suggest using a Robust Decision Making approach (Lempert and Groves 2010; Kalra et al. 2014) to identify mitigation strategies that are most robust to uncertainty (e.g., with minimum regret across all future scenarios) and to avoid strategies that can lead to catastrophic failure (i.e., very high system cost).
