      WOMENS VOICE, GENDER REVIEW OF NSP AND LESSONS FOR THE CITIZENS CHARTER 
      REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FOR SELECTION OF FIRM
      
      1. Background:
      The National Solidarity Program (NSP), under the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD), is the largest development program in Afghanistan and was launched in 2003 and has since then been ongoing.  The program works through a community-led methodology with the objective to improve socio-economic development of rural communities across Afghanistan and to lay the foundation for strengthened community-level governance. Womens representation and participation in Community Development Councils (CDCs), the democratically elected bodies that NSP establishes at the village level, has been a cornerstone of the program. The establishment of Community Development Councils (CDCs) was seen as the institutional mechanism to plan and implement sub-projects which are funded by block grants through accountable and transparent mechanisms. In other words, CDCs are to provide forums and spaces for more inclusive discussions and deliberations in the context of communities development needs and priorities. The existing informal bodies of local governance, dispute settlement and arbitration were traditionally dominated by tribal and clan elders and tended to be all male. It was envisioned that locally elected representatives, including women, from each neighborhood in the community, would engage people in planning and implementation of the various sub-projects, thereby creating the conditions for democratic processes to take hold. NSP and MRRDs various other programs have contributed towards improvements in womens lives through gender-sensitive strategies, e.g. womens inclusion and participation in CDCs and Cluster CDCs, facilitation by women social mobilizers, flexible institutional arrangements (women only, mixed, and parallel committees), livelihood and business development interventions, etc.  To strengthen and institutionalize womens participation in CDCs, NSPs Gender Oversight Committees decided to institute a quota system for women in the core committee of the CDCs for Repeater Block Grants, as well as the introduction of contractual obligations on the part of Facilitating Partners to recruit women social mobilizers. At the same time, MRRD/NSP recognizes that inclusion in councils does not necessarily translate into participation and voice and there is a need to better understand the factors that are conducive to or prevent womens ability to participate in CDC discussions, decision making and representation of their interests. Scholars have noted that adding women and making spaces for them is essential, but not enough to address historical and culturally embedded forms of disadvantages. In fact, enhancing womens potential in democratic spaces rests to some extent on their experiences in civil society associations and informal arenas in which skills are learnt and constituencies are built.
      NSP has seen womens participation progress over time. When CDCs were receiving their first round of block grants, approximately 35% of all CDC members were female. Among CDCs which have progressed to the second block grant, 45% of the members are women. More dramatically, among CDCs who had received their first block grant (prior to the officer quota), only 4% of all officer positions in CDCs were held by women; for CDCs who are receiving a second block grant (for whom the quota applies), the proportion of women holding officer positions has risen to 38%. In total, there are now 2,678 female officers nationwide in CDCs.
      
      2. Scope of services: 
      The objective of the task is to inform future programming approaches particularly for the Citizens Charter on women empowerment, voice, and agency. Building on existing research reports, this study should assess and document experiences of female CDC officers and members by examining and identifying their constraints, challenges and success in participating in their current roles given the different socio-economic and political contexts that characterize rural Afghanistan. The study should provide: 
      a.	Assessment of the effectiveness of the quota system put in place by NSP including perceptions of both men, women and the respective communities of it; 
      b.	Identification of factors that support and promote womens community-level leadership in CDCs, along with recommendations for Government on how these factors could further be enabled and empowered through the Citizens Charter,  
      c.	Identification of critical constraints to womens effective leadership and decision-making in CDCs on the different personal, communal and macro levels, and
      d.	Documentation of different modalities that supported womens participation and empowerment and their respective successes and challenges along with recommendations for future programming.
