      Assignment Description:
      The World Bank is assisting Local Government Authorities in Tanzania to implement a number of investments through PPP, in particular those projects that would not require any public funding (aside from land contributions) and might generate new sources of revenues for the LGAs. 
      As part of the project preparation, the Word Bank is seeking a firm to undertake studies that will assess the viability of the projects in light of the economic, legal, financial, market, socio/environmental, affordability and value for money factors. The studies will allow the LGAs to determine the projects viability, whether they should pursue a PPP solution for the selected facilities, and what form of PPP should be developed. The Local Government Authorities will be the Contracting Authority (CA) for the PPP projects.
       The consultant will also be responsible for building the capacity of selected team in the Presidents Office  Regional Administration and Local Government (PO-RALG) and LGAs representatives who will be tasked with managing the implementation of the projects. 
      Duration and Methodology:
      The assignment is expected to be conducted over a 6-months period, starting from 15th February, 2016. The firm is being engaged by the CA to provide the CA with sufficient information to justify acceptance, modification or rejection of the proposed projects for further financing and implementation. The CA is the ultimate beneficiary and the decision making body, and each aspect of the consultants activities and deliverables will be subject to CAs review and approval. The tasks will be completed in consultation with the CA and the other relevant government agencies. At certain stages in the process, the consultant will require the CAs support in obtaining and generating the data required to undertake proper viability studies.
      The consulting firm is also responsible for building the capacity of CAs key personnel throughout the study process so they fully understand the appraisal of PPP projects.
