      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
      
      IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest multilateral provider of financing for private enterprise in emerging markets. IFC provides loans, equity, structured finance and risk management tools as well as advisory services (AS) to build the private sector in developing countries. The Financial Institutions Group (FIG) has combined investment and advisory teams that offer joint solutions to financial intermediary clients to address their financing needs and offer know-how and tools to use the capital to their best advantage. 
      
      IFCs Secured Transactions and Collateral Registries product focuses on creating the conditions to allow the use of movable assets/property (such as inventory, accounts receivable, vehicles, equipment, crops, livestock, etc.) as collateral to generate loans. The team works with government institutions, financial institutions and the private sector to create better conditions for firms to be able to access more credit.
      
      IFCs Secured Transactions and Collateral Registry Program
      
      IFCs secured transactions and collateral registry program objective is to increase access to credit to firms, especially MSMEs, by developing the appropriate legal and institutional framework to allow and facilitate the use of movable assets as collateral for loans. The Program supports advisory projects primarily in low income and emerging market countries focusing on the following interventions: 
      	Legal Framework: Advice to governments, law and policy makers, and financial sector players on the necessary improvements to the legal and regulatory infrastructure for secured lending.
      	Development of Collateral Registry: Advice to the government and other stakeholders for the creation of new on-line registry for security interests in movable property or the improvement of the existing ones.
      	Capacity Building: Training and awareness-building among public stakeholders on implementation of and compliance with new laws and regulations. Awareness-building among creditors on the use of the new system in place and training of creditors on movable asset-based lending products and practices.
      
      A number of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have or will soon have the necessary legal and institutional infrastructure for secured financing with movables to take place; however, the financial sector has not adapted its business lines or developed the financial products that take full advantage of new laws and collateral registries for lending to MSMEs using movable assets as collateral. IFC is seeking to target Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras and other potentially strategic countries to develop the market for asset-based lending among financial institutions.
      
      Objectives
      The overall project objective is to promote financial inclusion to MSMEs by supporting the financial sector to develop movable asset-based lending products and services through the use of modernized laws and collateral registries. Specifically, the objectives of this consultancy are to implement the following in the target countries:
      	Build market awareness and capacity of the financial sector, MSMEs and relevant government entities to adapt their lending to employ collateral registries and engage in asset-based lending.  
      	Assess the local MSME market for secured transactions and asset-based lending, and assist financial institutions in identifying market actors and market segments, regions and industries, prepared to take advantage of secured transactions with movables.
      	Provide advisory assistance to financial institutions in designing new commercial lending products, and tailoring current commercial lending products, to take advantage of the new legal systems and collateral registries for all market segments, including MSMEs. 
      	Designing and developing new materials to be used in individual advisory engagements focused on asset-based lending with financial institutions. The type of materials to be developed will include manuals, policies, methodologies, best practices, business plans, model loan and security agreements and other such tools related to asset-based lending.   
      	Deliver individual advisory services to develop a sound asset-based lending practice to at least two financial institutions in the target countries.
