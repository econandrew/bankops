      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1231044 - Urban sanitation studies in Kigali
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Rwanda
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      This task is part of a larger technical assistance effort which aims to provide tools for improving sanitation services that can contribute to the City of Kigali's own upgrading program of unplanned settlements as well as complement the IDA-financed Rwanda Urban Development Project investments focused on Kigalis Nyarugenge District and the EIBs investment in a first-phase sewerage network in the same district.  As part of this effort, engagement with water and sanitation policy makers will be required in order to address the current lacunae of policies and strategies for urban sanitation. 
      
      This task will generate three key studies related to urban sanitation for two unplanned settlements in Kigali, Rwanda (each with an estimated population of 20,000 inhabitants). The three studies include: 1) Urban Sanitation Status Index; 2) Diagnostic of Small Private Service Providers; and 3) Household Behavior.  Significant surveys will need to be conducted in each of the targeted unplanned settlements.
      
      The results of these background studies will provide decision-makers with a more accurate understanding of the status of sanitation services, behaviors of households, and the experience of informal service providers (e.g. pit emptiers).  The conclusions and recommendations of these studies will form the basis for developing an upgrading strategy in Nyarugenge that includes improved sanitation service delivery for low-income settlements.
