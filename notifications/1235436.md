      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1235436 - Baseline Data Collection for The Kenya Tea Development Agency(KTDA) Project
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Kenya
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The International Finance Corporation proposes to conduct a baseline data collection exercise, which will include topics on poverty, food consumption and gender. The data collection, aimed at farmers, will be conducted in two rounds: baseline and end-line. IFC is looking to hire an experienced survey firm to conduct the first round of data collection - the baseline data collection  - in Kenya as part of an assessment of the impact the project has made through a) improving farmer productivity through soil fertility management and thereby helping farmers to improve their livelihoods and (b) strengthening farmer business skills.
      
      The questionnaire will likely include questions on income/livelihood, business skills, gender smart solutions and food security/consumption. The survey firm will work closely with staff from IFC and is expected to provide regular updates over email or telephone.
      
      The impact assessment methodology is developed by IFCs Development Impact unit in partnership with KTDA, and includes qualitative and quantitative research methods. Comparison of data collected at pre- and post-intervention level will allow an assessment of the projects impact. 
      
      The survey firm will collect data from 50 farmers per tea factory (65 factories in total). The firm is expected to interview approximately 3,250 smallholder farmers. Given that women are involved in the farming and processing of tea, the assessment will include a gender survey for the smallholder farmers (with a sufficient number of men and women included into the sample). The gender-related questions will be provided by IFCs Gender Secretariat. 
      
      Prior to conducting interviews the firm will review the questionnaires with IFC to ensure that all questions are aligned with the local context and practices. 
      The external firm is responsible for logistics and inviting respondents to participate. Data collection should occur at the farm/home sight of the respondent. GPS coordinates for all smallholders at their farm or home must be recorded at the time of the interview or at the very least GPS coordinates should be collected from the farm/home of the respondents.
      
      The external firm is to conduct the following:
      Step 1: Brief desk review of existing project documents and external documents that are identified as relevant. The end result of this will lead to the inception report
      Step 2: Hiring and training of enumerators with IFC Staff and KTDA invited to attend (attendance will be at the discretion of IFC and KTDA)
      Step 3: Finalization of questionnaire: review and translation as well as pilot testing of questionnaire which can be done as part of enumerator training
      Step 4: Data collection in the field which will include capturing of GPS data points through tablet technology
      Step 5: Code and clean data set prior to transmission to IFC
