      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Mindanao Trust Fund-Reconstruction & Development Project supports socio-economic recovery in conflict-affected areas of Mindanao. The project works primarily through the Bangsamoro Development Agency, the development arm of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which signed a peace agreement with the Government of the Philippines in 2012. 
      
      The project has supported community development investments such as community-based infrastructure and small-scale income-generating projects in over 300 villages since 2006. 
      
      Implementation of the program has been broken into phases under discrete Program Partnership Agreements (PPAs). This assignment is for an assessment of the impact of activities under Program Partnership Agreement 4, which ran from 2012-2015 in 65 villages. It will also cover a sample of sites from ongoing work in 91 villages. 
      
      Using quantitative and qualitative data gathering methods, the assessment will evaluate impacts on a series of social and economic indicators.
