      The evaluation employs a rigorous randomization design and the related baseline survey is being implemented in parallel to the project. The Impact Evaluation (IE) has been designed by an independent research team and is partially funded through the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality Trust Fund (UFGE), a competitive and peer-reviewed funding mechanism for gender innovations. The research design builds on a random assignment of qualified youth into treatment and control groups during the Entrepreneurship Bootcamps. The baseline study will cover ca. 100 bootcamps throughout the country (in urban and rural areas) targeting ca. 1000 youth in the treatment and control group, respectively (total sample size is ca. 2000 youth), which will allow a detailed analysis of treatment effects. In particular the evaluation has been designed to measure the project impact on the following outcomes:
      i.	The effect of entrepreneurship training on the development of entrepreneurial skills and attitudes; the ability to secure external funds; and the probability to start and expand a business.
      ii.	The differentiated impact for young men and women regarding the above outcomes, with a focus on the effectiveness of the gender-sensitive design features of the project.
      iii.	The impact on business practices, including additional income and job creation among successful training participants compared to young entrepreneurs who did not receive entrepreneurship training.
      iv.	The relative impact of post-creation training on the sustainability of new and expanded firms, including creation of employment opportunities and income.
