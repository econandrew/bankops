      SureCash is a mobile financial service (MFS) platform developed by Progoti Systems Limited. SureCash users can access their mobile money account via a USSD menu on featurephones.
      The mobile wallet functionalities provided through USSD are also offered through the SureCash mobile application available for Android smartphones. The SureCash mobile app is currently in its first version (SureCash App V1), and it is the focus of this proposal.
      Progoti System Limited has established partnerships with more than 200 educational institutions, enabling such institutions to collect and manage student tuition fees via SureCash wallet for more than 350,000 students. This student population pays college tuition through SureCash. A majority of students transact using the USSD menu, leveraging agents located near college locations for cash deposits. Only a handful of students use SureCash wallet mobile app.
      The objective of this project is to increase mobile app adoption and usage among students (Convert), to generate a baseline measurement (Evaluate) against which to measure and monitor improvements in usage metric (Engage).
      World Bank/CGAP plans to enroll the services of a Digital Marketing Agency (DMA) with proven expertise to assist in all aspects of mobile app digital marketing, including services related to audience analysis, app store optimization, campaign monitoring, application installation, user activation, usage data analysis, etc.
      The selected vendor will provide WB/CGAP with expertise to engage, convert and evaluate the existing student population with respect of installation and usage of SureCash App V1.
