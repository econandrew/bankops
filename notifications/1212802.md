      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1212802 - Nepal: Building Government Capacity through Support of Upper Trishuli-1 (UT1) Negotiations
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Nepal
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Nepal, despite having over 43 GW of economically viable hydropower potential, has built capacity of only around 791 MW.  In 2013, peak demand was over 1,200 MW, resulting in power cuts of up to 12 hours/day.  The energy demand across Nepal in FY13-14 was estimated at 5,909 GWh, only 78 percent of which could be supplied. In order to expand access to modern, high quality electricity services for the citizens of Nepal and to realize the potential for Nepals hydropower exports to the wider South Asian region, there is a need to expand hydropower generation. Nepals own resources  both technical and financial, are insufficient to develop this potential, and hence investment as well as expertise from private sector will be crucial for growth of this capital intensive sector.
        
      At 216 MW, Upper Trishuli 1 Hydropower Project (Project or UT-1) is currently the largest private sector power project for domestic consumption.  The Power Development Agreement (PDA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for this Project are currently under active negotiations, where private investors are well represented by international legal counsel, as well as financial advisors with significant experience. The World Bank has received a request from the Government of Nepal (the Government) to help support them during the negotiations of UT-1, with the understanding that this will help them build their knowledge and expertise, beyond UT-1 itself. There is a need to develop capacity within the Government to learn about and negotiate financeable hydropower contracts PDAs, PPAs, and others  with potential private investors. 
       
      This consulting assignment will provide adequate support in these key areas to the Government  specifically to the Ministry of Energy (MoE), and the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), but possibly also to other agencies as directed by the Government.
      This assignment will facilitate development of a market-tested contractual framework that will allow private sector investment in a specific hydropower resource in Nepal in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner  something that is crucial to advancing the electricity access agenda in the country. Please note that scope of this assignment is to provide the Government and NEA with analysis and expert knowledge on key issues pertinent to the UT-1 project, in particular, and related broader issues that affect the decision making in the countrys hydropower project development.  The decisions with respect to these issues are to be taken by the Government and NEAs officers, and not the firms hired to provide consultancy services.
      
      This assignment will entail assessing the Projects financial, technical, and economic aspects, and the implications of technical choices on the financial and commercial aspects. During the period of the PDA and PPA negotiations, the Consultants will assist the Government in understanding the complex issues outstanding, in line with standard market practices and legal norms, with particular emphasis on the following key issues:
      
        a. Incorporation/adoption of hard currency component in the PPA tariff in hydel projects developed with investments in foreign currencies based on global and regional practices;
      
        b. Quantitative assessment of the PPA/PDAs impacts on the financial and technical performance of Nepals power sector, and presenting options for the Projects structure, based on international best practices, for the Government to consider in order to mitigate key Project risks on the sectors performance; and
      
        c. Analysis of the various options (including the costs and benefits of each), based on international best practices and Nepals local conditions, for structuring the Projects wholesale tariff for the Government to consider while formulating its own positions in PPA discussions with the Projects private sector sponsors.
      
      In addition, the Consultant will be helping the Government in assessing sector-wide implications of entering into concessional and commercial agreements under a PPP framework. The Consultants will also support the Government in understanding the impact of the Projects economic, financial, and risk allocation on domestic and export markets. In this regard, knowledge of hydropower projects in Nepal, South Asia, and the larger global context is deemed important to help the Government in making decisions, including the likely Nepal-India cross-border power trade on issues like pricing, wheeling, losses, etc. 
       
      Working alongside Governments representatives, the Consultant will have access to information and tools in developing a sectoral view.  The Consultant is expected to assist the Governments representatives understand the Projects risk allocation, from the perspective of impacts on Nepals power sector, and to present various options (including their costs and benefits) to mitigate adverse effects for the Governments representatives to consider when formulating their own negotiating positions on the PPA. While the Government is expected to have separate legal counsel, the Consultant may be asked, from time to time, to help the Government understand legal issues and present the Governments representatives options to consider while deciding how to deal with legal issues.
      
      The World Bank is inviting firms with extensive experience in supporting power sector public private partnership projects in emerging economies to submit Expression of Interest (EoI). Firms with demonstrated experience of supporting negotiations and financing hydropower projects in the South Asia region are encouraged to apply.
