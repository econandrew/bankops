      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Lighting Africa, a joint World Bank/IFC program aims at helping  address the lighting needs of consumers who rely on fuel-based kerosene lamps and candles by enabling them access to non-fossil fuel-based, low-cost, high-quality, safe, and reliable lighting products. 
      Following the successful launch of the program in Nigeria in March 2015, a pan-Nigeria consumer education campaign commenced with the objective of increasing awareness and adoption of solar lighting products in Nigeria. An assessment of the impact of the campaign revealed growing awareness of solar lighting products. The Lighting Africa, Nigeria Program has observed the increasing importance of digital marketing as a vital piece in the communication mix and is now seeking a marketing firm to deliver a high-impact consumer education campaign that builds on initial digital activities and amplifies the ATL and BTL efforts to achieve accelerated behavior change and drive rapid sales of quality verified solar lighting products.
