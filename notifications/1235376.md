      Request for the Expression of Interest
      Consultancy Services for an institutional assessment, market study and capacity assessment for the port sector in East and Southern Africa
      .
      Name of the Project: Port Competition in East Africa
      Sector: Transport
      Project ID No: AS-P161111-ASA-.BB
      .
      A.	Background
      1.	Over the period 2005-2014, Africa displayed strong economic performance, averaging GDP growth of about 5 percent per year, despite the global financial crisis in 2009.  Whilst economic growth across the continent is projected to fall to 1.6 percent this yearthe lowest level in over two decades, the medium term perspective is a modest rebound in 2017, with economic activity expected to rise to 2.9 percent.  As a result, over the last 15 years, Africas total trade has increased from US$200 billion to nearly US$1 trillion, growing annually at 12 percent. Despite the current dip, global demand for Africas natural resources is likely to remain strong in the medium term. Traditionally, Africa exports natural resources, which account for 70 percent of the regions total exports. About US$230 billion of fuel and mining products and US$50 billion of agricultural products are exported every year, primarily through the maritime ports of the region. As the individual economies recover/continue to grow, the demand for inter alia consumer goods, vehicles, construction materials, and agricultural inputs are likely to increase vigorously, resulting in further growth in imports through the maritime ports of the region.
      . 
      2.	Against this backdrop of strong economic performance, many of the existing port facilities and current operational practices have proved inadequate, with poor spatial and operating efficiency and capacity limitations. Consequently, along the East and Southern African coast, all the major regional ports are either implementing, or planning, considerable expansions to meet projected demand. The justification for many of these plans is the ambition to develop as a regional hub, serving both an expanded and sometimes overlapping hinterland and the transshipment market. However, there are 70 ports in East Arica, and not all of these can be/will be regional or global hubs despite the ambition; economies of scale mean that some ports will become even larger, while others will need to recognize that their role will be more specialized, either focusing on serving a sub-region, a particular commodity group, or acting as a feeder port at the end of one of the spokes. The development of larger scale regional hub ports will reinforce the need to improve the efficiency of both the feeder ports, but also the sub-regional and island feeder services, particularly for the ocean economies, such as Mauritius and Madagascar.  Sub-regional ports will continue to play an important role in local economies, the hub and spoke network, and the development of efficient links will enhance the position of the regional hub.

      B.	The Objective of the Assignment
      3.	The overall objective of the Assignment is to prepare an institutional assessment, strategic market analysis, and capacity assessment for the major ports  of East Africa, given current demand, the current trends in the industry, and the projected macro-economic environment. The analysis should cover the potential for container, liquid and dry bulk, general cargo, and vehicles in the major ports. The secondary objectives of the assignment are: (i) to undertake an analysis of the institutional structure of port management and operations for each of the main ports, in terms of the legal, regulatory and policy framework, noting any deficiencies or shortcomings; (ii) to undertake a comparable assessment of the structure and scale of port tariffs in each country, and note shortcomings in the area; (iii) to produce updated demand forecasts for a defined 30 year period for all the major ports of the region for the different cargo groups; (iv) to provide a summary of planned expansions in each of the major competing ports, indicating what is proposed, planned and committed; and (v) to provide an indication of the capacity needs of the major ports in the 8 countries over the next 30 years.
      .
      C.	The Scope of the Assignment 
      4.	The Consultant will be expected to undertake, but not limited to, the following activities: 
      	Task B  A Detailed Review of the Institutional Framework of the Ports Sector. This task focuses on the institutional (legal, regulatory and policy) framework of the ports sector in each of the eight countries hosting the twelve main ports identified in footnote 1.  The consultant will be required to review and analyze the existing legal and regulatory framework, organization arrangements, (sub-) sectoral policies, financing and cost recovery, and co-ordination and monitoring, with a view of assessing any obvious shortcomings in each area and if possible illustrate with an example of good practice coming out from a suitable country case study.
      	Task C  Market Demand Study. The second task for the Consultant will be the preparation of a market demand study for the main ports of the region by commodity group (container, liquid and dry bulk, general cargo, and vehicles). 
      	Task D  Demand Forecasts. The third task for the Consultant will be the preparation of demand forecasts for the main ports of the region, by main commodity group, based on defined income elasticities, for the defined (30 year) horizon. 
      	Task E  The Economic Case for Capacity Enhancement.  The Consultant will be expected to prepare a strategic evaluation of the economic case for necessary capacity enhancement/port development, to a pre-feasibility level of analysis, to facilitate the identification of the most economically efficient options across the region, and a provisional timeline for optimal implementation.  
      5.	Given the above, the Consultant will be expected to prepare an estimate of the capacity needs for the main ports of the region, and any planned new ports, by commodity group, for the defined (30 year) horizon, indicating where enhancement is needed, and where capacity, given current planned and committed expansion plans, would appear to exceed potential demand.  The potential diversionary impacts of new greenfield ports would be included in this activity
      .
      D. 	The Resources required for the Assignment
      6.	The consultant is free to propose his own team for the assignment, but the assignment is intended to be undertaken by an experienced multidisciplinary team, comprising at a minimum, a lawyer/regulatory expert, a senior transport economist and a senior port specialist very familiar with the ports sector and with the countries of the East and Southern Africa region.  The Consultant will be expected to provide approximately 10-12 person months of international staff inputs. The contract for this assignment will be a lump sum contract. 
      7.	Consortiums price. Although payment for the services is lump sum, the financial offer of the Consultant shall nevertheless include and specify all cost items, such as salaries and other staff remunerations, domestic and international travel costs, accommodation, per-diem, local transportation, office costs, reproduction of reports, etc.
