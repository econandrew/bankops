      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The objective of the assignment is to provide advisory support to improve mobility conditions by developing a city level parking policy and management plan in Bhubaneswar. Bhubaneswar, ranked as the number 1 city in the Government of India Smart Cities Challenge, in its Smart City Proposal has identified mobility as big challenge for city's future development. However, growth of city and its vehicular population has resulted in an increase in parking demand. Lack of parking facilities is emerging as a crucial issue in the city leading to congestion and safety issues as well. The city recognizes the need to cater to the increasing demand in parking in a balanced and sustainable manner. Hence, Bhubaneshwar Development authority (BDA) wants to develop a two pronged approach to address parking issues - a) develop a city level Parking Policy; and b) develop a Parking Management Plan. Key tasks involved would be as follows 
      1) Assessment of existing and future parking demand in Bhubaneshwar based on parking surveys, data collection, analysis and future demand assessment. 
      2) Development of Parking Policy for Bhubaneshwar to guide the development of planned parking facilities such that they are in line with the citys Smart City goals, urban transit objectives and are integrated with the citys development plans. 
      3) Development of Parking Management Plan - based on existing and future parking demand, identify existing parking issues, develop a phased plan to manage existing and future parking demand and supply (on-street and off-street), keeping in mind development of mass transit facilities, smart technologies, land use integration etc., determine an optimal pricing policy, develop a parking regulation and enforcement framework to effectively manage parking in future.
