      1.The FIRST-funded Lebanon: Strengthening Insurance Sector Regulation and Supervision Project seeks to assist the Insurance Control Commission (ICC) of Lebanon in the development of guidelines for the sound and consistent implementation of Motor Third Party Liability (MTPL) insurance (covering both bodily injury and material damage), and to support the development of a risk-based supervisory regime more broadly. This will contribute to increased insurance penetration, consumer protection, and stability.
      2.The World Bank is seeking an individual to support the above project, specifically with respect to the need for a local consultant to deliver elements of a component covering enhancements to the MTPL product line in the insurance market in Lebanon, and for related project support activities. 
      
      It is expected that the consultant will work on the project deliverables supporting a combination of team missions in Beirut and activities between missions. The consultant will work with the international consultant particularly by adding a local perspective and in ensuring that international recommendations are adjusted to reflect local requirements. The tasks of the local consultant include ongoing liaison with the sector between missions, gathering additional background information as needed on a continuous basis between missions, supporting drafting efforts to ensure local cultural, legal and contextual sensitivity, and managing the logistical efforts required for consultation with stakeholders (including the transparent management of what is expected to be a large volume of detailed comments to be received). 
      The consultant will support the delivery of the following:
      
      I.Localizing Guidelines for the Sound and Consistent Implementation of Motor Third Party Liability Insurance including:
      
      a.Advice on policy conditions and benefits for MTPL and design of BI and MD claims guidelines including advice on (i) the drafting of a unified policy wording to be used by all insurance companies, and (ii) the design of MD and BI claims guidelines for an objective assessment of the claim severity and insurance benefits.
      
      b.Working with the international consultant, the consultant will support the delivery of a unified policy wording to be used by all insurance companies (wording will describe the benefits in cases of BI and MD, and the corresponding scale as applicable); BI and MD claims guidelines (wording will describe situations in which a claim is excluded from the insurance coverage).
      
      II.Localizing advice on Pricing, Reserving, and Performance Monitoring including advice on:
      
      a.the design of a continuous process to evaluate and publish a minimum tariff structure;
      
      b.rules regarding policy fees and their reporting;
      
      c.the design of regular performance monitoring reports to be filed with the ICC on combined market and company-by-company bases; and
      
      d.the design of a prudential reserving process. 
      
      III.Working with the international consultant, the consultant will develop guidelines for the supervisory process to evaluate and to publish a minimum tariff structure (which should cover the cost of Hit and Run, the cost of running a centralized database, the cost of running a clearinghouse, and additional supervisory fees); sharing of best practices regarding rules for policy fees and reporting; guidelines and best practice recommendations for performance monitoring reports to be filed with ICC; and recommendations for the design of a prudential reserving process.
      
      5.The assignment is expected to start in January 2017 and be completed by March 2018. 
      
      6.The consultant will report to Roya Vakil (Financial Sector Specialist and TTL of this activity). The consultant will also work under the guidance of Craig Thorburn (Lead Financial Sector Specialist, GFM3A) who is the Technical Lead (TL) assigned to the project to address technical, quality control and related issues. The TL provides peer review of all draft and final reports and may provide guidance to consultants on project related issues of a technical nature. The consultants will need to ensure that the TTL and TL clear all relevant communication with the client and any other stakeholders.
      
      7.The World Bank will also make available internet based facilities such as conference calling, webinar meeting facilities (WebEx), and cloud based file storage and sharing (via box.com) to ensure that the ICC, TTL, TL and consultants are able to collaborate between missions.
      
      8.There is no travel cost allowance in the contract for this consultancy.
      
      9.EoIs should also include:
      
      A clear statement of any constraints in availability that the individuals may have regarding periods of travel to Beirut during the expected time of the project;
      
      Contact information that includes phone, email, postal address, country of citizenship, country of residency for taxation purposes, and the contractors UPI number if having done contracted work with the World Bank previously.
      
      10.EoIs should recognize that the project includes peer review and quality control by the TL separately from the contracts. Individuals may choose to include separate peer review if they wish or need to for their own professional reasons, but no separate contractual arrangements can be made for such reviews.
      
      11.Interested consultants please send resume, expression of interest, and financial proposal (daily rate) to Roya Vakil (rvakil@worldbank.org) and Craig Thorburn (cthorburn@worldbank.org) no later than January 2, 2017.
