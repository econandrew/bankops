      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The KGFS Model, operated by IFMR Rural Channels, is a unique wealth management approach to servicing low income households in rural India. CGAP is partnering with IFMR Rural Channels to improve the current algorithm and rules guiding product advisory by leveraging historical data to create distinct customer segments and tailor advisory and recommendations to each segment. We believe an improved tool for wealth managers can be developed by analyzing how households have interacted with products historically and how their well-being has evolved.   
      
      In the short term, the project expects to achieve the following:
      a)	Develop a customer segmentation 
      b)	Improve product recommendations for each customer segment 
      c)	Customize and tailor communication and advice for each segment
      d)	Increase product uptake by customers as recommendations become more tailored to their needs
      The long term objective is to achieve an improvement in financial well-being for the customers.
