By bringing together the four variables of people, space, risks, access to infrastructure and services, the findings and recommendations from this exercise will enable municipal decision-makers to better target social, anti-poverty, and other development interventions.

The survey will also provide information on the location of households, jobs, socio-economic characteristics, access to the job market, sector of occupation, mobility, housing situation, expenditure on housing and basic services.
