      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1212879 - Value for Money analysis of GEF Land Degradation Projects
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Independent Evaluation Office of the Global Environment Facility (GEF IEO) is requesting Expressions of Interest (Eol) from suitable national and/or international consulting firms and/or institutions to assist the Office in Value for Money (VFM) analysis for GEF supported land degradation projects specifically combatting desertification and deforestation.
      
      Objectives and Tasks
      The objective for these specific terms of reference is to estimate the VFM of about 181 GEF supported land degradation focal area projects. The analysis will also examine the VFM of the benefits these land degradation projects provide in other focal areas such as Biodiversity and Climate Change along four main attributes: (a) vegetation productivity b) forest fragmentation (c) carbon stocks and sequestration, and (d) land cover change. The objectives will be achieved through the completion of the following tasks:
      
      1.	Developing a research protocol for the value for money analysis
      
      A research protocol detailing the approach and data sets will be developed for the value for money analysis. The main activities are:
       
      	Formulation of  research design based on econometric and ecosystem approach 
      	Development of VFM Indicator Framework
      	Determination of unit of analysis and counterfactuals
      	Preparation of a formal research protocol
      
      2.	Constructing a dataset containing globally available characteristics relevant to forest change
      
      In combination to developing the VFM research protocol, a relevant dataset will be created for the analysis. This will include the use of long-term high-resolution global satellite data together with latest available data on biodiversity values, global forest change, carbon stocks and land degradation.
      
      3.	Estimating the impact of GEF land degradation projects 
      
      Spatially explicit models will be developed to estimate the impact of GEF projects on global environmental benefits and based on the application of these models, the impact of four main attributes: (a) vegetation productivity b) forest fragmentation (c) carbon stocks and sequestration, and (d) land cover change, of GEF projects in different spatial contexts. Uncertainty estimates associated with the data and the model would also be reported as part of the analysis. 
      
      4.	Report on the Value for money analysis of GEF land degradation projects
      
      A report will be prepared to translate the impact of GEF projects into monetary values, based on existing literature and studies, and assessing those monetized benefits against project costs to develop a value for money estimate. This will also report on quantitative indicators on forest fragmentation, land cover change and carbon stocks and how much the cohort of GEF supported land degradation projects have achieved in relation to the associated costs.
      
      5.	A summary report
      
      Based on the report prepared for task (4), a brief will be created that will include (a) findings from the application of the study, and (b) a detailed set of steps taken to reach study conclusions. 
      
      6.	Development of a prototype for future decision support
      
      A prototype of an interactive tool for decision support will be created.
      
      7.	Knowledge Management Products to promote innovation 
      
      VFM Indicator Framework, geospatial datasets, static and interactive maps, relevant information and knowledge gathered during VFM analysis will be compiled and shared with stakeholders. These knowledge management products can be helpful for other studies on multiple benefits and a focal area study on land degradation.
      Timeline
      
      The project needs to be completed within 4 months from the date of award of the contract (by June 30, 2016). 
      
      INDIVIDUAL / FIRM PROFILE
      The consultant will be a firm. 
      
      Team Requirements and Expertise
      1)	Advanced degrees in a subject matter related to the work. 
      2)	Experience working on ecosystem valuation, geospatial and remote sensing analysis. 
      3)	Team Composition:
      
      - Team Leader with at least 15 years of experience in the areas of environmental evaluation. Demonstrated experience in similar projects including the ecosystem services for of Biodiversity, Climate Change, Land Degradation; Excellent publication record in this area.
