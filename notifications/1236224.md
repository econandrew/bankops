      IFC is seeking a highly motivated Communications Consultant for its Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services Advisory Unit in sub Saharan Africa.  The three sectors are identified as priorities to drive Africas economic growth. 
       
      The World Bank estimates that by 2030 agriculture could develop into a US$ 1 trillion industry in Sub-Saharan Africa.  As a member of the World Bank Group, and the worlds largest development organization focused on the private sector, IFC can bring to bear significant resources to help develop modern agribusiness sectors that meet citizens needs and help African firms become globally competitive.

IFCs MAS Advisory team supports the development of a modern commercial agribusiness sector by linking producers to local, regional and global markets. MAS Advisory also guides farmers on social and environmental practices, and sustainable value chains.  IFC works closely with companies across Africa to train farmers, ensure quality inputs, invest in critical infrastructure and equipment to reduce post-harvest losses
