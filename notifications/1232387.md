      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      With a growing stock of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in developing countries, many host country Governments are interested in better leveraging FDI for local private sector development. However, the much desired linkages and technology transfer between FDI and local firms does not happen automatically. Targeted interventions are often required to overcome the usual market failures and constraints that exist in the overall enabling environment for linkages as well as around local firm capacity and competitiveness.
      
      The World Bank Group is working with a growing number of countries interested to make tangible progress in this particular area. The main sectors in focus include manufacturing (garments/apparel, electronics, automotive) and extractives (oil, gas & mining)as well as agribusiness and tourism.
      
      In this context we are looking for experienced firms and/or individual experts to help deliver market based policy interventions and solutions that will lead to improved integration of local firms and SME's in MNE supply chains and global value chains in general. 
      
      Amongst others, the following areas of experience and expertise are of interest:
      1. Conducting demand - supply opportunity/gap analysis
      2. Developing a FDI/Special Economic Zone (SEZ)linkages strategy and action plan 
      3. Improving the policy and enabling business environment for promoting FDI linkages 
      4. Developing a high quality supplier databases and related matchmaking services
      5. Designing and implementing supplier development programs, including the benchmarking and targeted capacity building of participating SMEs
