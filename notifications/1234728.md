      The Emergency Education System Stabilization Project (EESSP) is a $32 million grant from the Lebanon Syrian Crisis Multi-Donor Trust Fund that has as its development objective to support the operational needs of Lebanese public schools and to improve the learning environment in response to the continued influx of Syrian refugee children, as part of the overall Reaching All Children With Education (RACE) strategy of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE). In order to achieve this outcome, the following activities are grouped into three components: (i): Support to Schools; (ii) Learning Environment Quality; and (iii) Project Management and Support. The three-year project aims to address two central human development and education system challenges facing Lebanon: maintaining the ability of schools to provide education services and maintaining the quality of the learning environment.
