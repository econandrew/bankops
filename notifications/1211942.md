      The World Bank Group seeks to hire a local Short Term Consultant as a Lead Technical Advisor for Services, Manufacturing and Refinancing to support the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) with the implementation of the MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive finance $500 million Lending Project from the World Bank Group to SIDBI in India.
      
      The MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive finance project  focuses on expanding access to finance and innovating on financial products to MSMEs in three key underserved sectors: (i) startups and risk capital financing, (ii) the service sector and (iii) the manufacturing sector to help unlock the market for lending to MSMEs at all stages of growth. Furthermore, the World Bank SIDBI project, also seeks to expand access to financing of MSMES across Low Income States (LIS), and North-East India (NEI) wherever possible, as well as focus on women entrepreneurs. SIDBI will directly provide funding to end-beneficiaries (MSMEs including start-ups) and will also on-lend to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) that will then lend to MSMEs (refinancing).
      
      As part of the parallel technical assistance supporting project implementation, the objective of the contract is to provide industry expertise and technical advice to enhance the implementation support of the MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive finance project.  The Lead Technical Advisor for Services, Manufacturing and Refinancing  (also referred to as  Lead Technical Advisor) will support and advise SIDBI on a variety of technical, institutional and financial issues linked to the Project and report to the World Bank team. 
        
      The Lead Technical Advisor will work closely with SIDBI Project Implementation Unit (PIU), as well as technical consultants, in innovating, developing and scaling up lending to the service and manufacturing sectors and in promoting and developing SIDBI refinancing lines to maximize outreach and development impact. The Lead Technical Advisor will play a critical role in delivering innovations in financial product design, partnerships and work closely with other entities in the ecosystem to help expand innovative service sector and manufacturing financing products, and as such will contribute substantively to achieving the results of the Project. He will support the objectives of components 2 and 3 of the Lending Project, respectively: Supporting Service Sector Financing Models and Supporting Finance to Manufacturing MSMEs and the projects objectives on refinancing.
      
      The overall mission statement for the Lead Technical Advisor is to support and advise SIDBI in delivering the targets of the World Bank Group MSME Growth, Innovation and Inclusive Finance Lending Project, more specifically projects targets in refinancing and in the Services and Manufacturing components (see attached Project Appraisal Document, PAD). This, by providing the technical, strategic and operational inputs to inform project implementation and enhance its effectiveness.
      
      The roles and responsibilities for coordination will be divided into three main goals:  (i). product development for services and manufacturing; (ii). direct financing pipeline development, processes enhancement and portfolio growth for services and manufacturing; (iii).  portfolio growth in indirect financing /refinancing. It is expected that the Lead Technical Advisor will play a role in active monitoring of key milestones and targets, coordinate technical consultancies and hires to ensure relevance and quality of outputs (including coordinate and reconcile deliverables, as required), and actively contribute to the overall strategic approach to reaching the goals of the project. The initial focus will be on developing partnerships for refinancing and product development on franchise financing, asset light and new manufacturing sector products (including cluster financing).
