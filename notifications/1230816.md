      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1230816 - Enabling women entrepreneurship through e-commerce
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - India
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sector is seen as a backbone of India's economy, with an estimated 29.8 million MSMEs contributing to 11.5 percent of GDP. Access to finance is a key constraint to growth of the MSME sector in India.  
      
      Although, their financing requirements are quite similar, data indicates that women entrepreneurs have lower access to finance from formal financing sources when compared with male entrepreneurs.
      
      IFC is working with a leading e-commerce marketplace player to increase the proportion of women entrepreneurs in their supply chain to at least 25% of the total seller base, promoting alternate collateral based financing and creating a new, larger market for their goods.
      
      The objective is to conduct research and analytics to support the development of a pilot program for the e-commerce marketplace player to reach a greater number of women entrepreneurs and narrow the gender finance and skills gap; specifically by:
      a)	Studying global best practices on promoting entrepreneurship in women
      b)	Reviewing models on how ecommerce platforms support women entrepreneurs as their vendors
      c)	Identifying global best practices for providing/ arranging capital assistance by e-commerce marketplaces to their vendors (with special focus on women vendors)
      d)	Study successful examples available globally on the importance and impact of non-financial services in promoting success of women entrepreneurs
      
      The review of global models will look at how other ecommerce models support women, access to finance and entrepreneurship and document lessons learned. As women entrepreneurs often lack the networks needed for information on supply chain opportunities and are not able to capitalize on them, this initiative will look for examples in the private sector that can be tailored and/ or replicated.
