      Assignment Title: 1211473 - Review of IFC's engagement in Izmir
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Turkey
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      IFCs partnership with the Municipality of Izmir spans over a decade of projects focused on priority sectors, including public transport, municipal waste, and wastewater network. The case study is commissioned to determine the development impact of IFCs engagement, as well as the extent to which IFC has developed a successful strategic urban engagement with the city of Izmir, in the last decade.  Key questions to be answered include: (1) How did the IFC engagement improve urban mobility, connectivity, safety, and climate friendly infrastructure?; 
      (2) What have been the benefit of implementing multiple projects with same municipality? Did it create impact that is larger than sum of individual project results; demonstration effect; or better capacity? (3) If there is indeed positive impact from multiple engagement, what measures can IFC take to ensure such synergy in future cities engagements?   Similarly, what indicators can IFC use to best assess and measure such impact?
