      IFC is seeking to contract a local firm to manage processing of monthly payments to 134 trainers spread across the KTDA tea growing zones.  Ability to process digital payments is preferred. The firm should ideally be based in Kenya with a good understanding and experience in managing similar payments particularly in the geographical areas covered by KTDA.
      
      IFC and KTDA are implementing a project funded by the Government of Japan that seeks to improve farmer business skills. The training project is 2 years.  However, IFC seeks to contract a firm for one year. The contract will be renewable subject to continuation of the project and satisfactory performance by the firm.
