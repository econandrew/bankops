      Albania climate vulnerability assessment for road assets
      This activity will conduct a climate vulnerability assessment on roads network in Albania, focusing on national roads with possible inclusion of secondary and local roads. The methodology builds on earlier experiences elsewhere (i.e., Mozambique and Peru), where the approach was found to be valuable and compelling. The methodology consists of five main steps as follows:
      Step 1: Identify critical links in the network  defined as links which have the greatest cost when disrupted:  a measure that combines the impact of traffic volume and lack of alternatives.
      Step 2:  Use hazard maps  floods and landslides, earthquake as relevant  to identify which elements of the network are most likely to be disrupted by climate events.
      Step 3:  Enhance the results of step 2 with a condition assessment where available and appropriate
      Step 4:  Combine the results of Step 1 and 3 to identify the highest priority links  which are most critical and at risk.  
      Step 5: Identify possible ways to improve network resilience either by strengthening the links identified or looking at alternative links possibly by upgrading existing links from a lower level network.  
      This activity will further develop this methodology and apply to the Albania network to prioritize investment for the country and for the Banks engagement in the road sector such as through the Albania Rural Roads Sector Project (P163239) and Albania Results-based Road Maintenance and Safety Project (P132982). Specifically, the recommendations from this activity would inform enhancements/upgrades to the secondary and local road network which could serve to provide redundancy and increase system resilience to the national roads network through P163293. The recommendations of strengthening national roads could also be implemented through the P132982. In addition, this activity will articulate the implications of the work for other Balkan countries.
      
      Another component of this activity is Development of a guideline on climate resilient designs and maintenance for low volume roads/local roads. 
      The low volume roads are often overlooked in climate resilient perspective. The proposed guideline will be practical, low-cost and effective in reducing risks of low volume roads from washing away from floods, landslides and other relevant events. 
      The guideline will be applied directly to the roads to be financed under the Albania Rural Roads Sector Project (P163239), and other local roads in the West Balkan region and worldwide.
