      Assignment Countries:
        - Niger
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The World Bank is seeking a firm to prepare and undertake baseline data collection for a long-term impact evaluation survey in Niger. The survey is a large-scale and complex survey. The sample will include approximately 3,500 households. The instruments will include a household survey that will be provided by the World Bank team and will include anthropometrics measurement of children under 5 years of age and water quality testing. 
      Baseline data is expected to be collected in approximately 150 villages in Dosso, Maradi, Zinder, Tillaberi and Tahoua. The data collection is expected to take place in late February/ early March 2017.
      
      The impact evaluation will evaluate an integrated WASH and cash transfer pilot as part of the Niger Adaptive Safety Nets Program. The pilot will salon include behavioral interventions aimed at increasing compliance and systematic use of water treatment and changes of sanitation behaviors. The key outcomes to be measured include: children anthropometrics (stunting, wasting); longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea (3-day
      point prevalence) among children aged under five; water treatment (chlorine residual) 
      
      Firms that have extensive experience on complex survey design in low capacity environment, computer assisted personal interviewing platforms, data collection for impact evaluation (in particular for randomized trials), anthropometric measurement of children and water quality testing (e.coli, nitrates and chlorine residuals), and prior experience working in rural settings similar to those in Niger to send expression of interest. 
      Shortlisted firms will be provided with detailed terms of reference to prepare detailed technical and financial proposals.
