      REPUBLIC OF UGANDA REVIEW AND UPDATE OF THE NATIONAL TRANSPORT POLICY AND STRATEGY
      Consultancy Services for Preparation of a National Transport & Logistics Policy and Strategy

      .
      A.	BACKGROUND
      .
      Transport and logistics are vital factors in economic development. An efficient transport system is a pre-requisite for economic and social transformation. Both transport and logistics directly impact on many sectors of the economy . They play a crucial role of facilitating mobility of goods and people for production, marketing, trade and commerce, public services delivery, social interaction/cohesion and regional integration. They thus play a catalytic role for economic growth and poverty reduction in an economy. Efficient transport and logistics are therefore critical elements for any country to grow as well as be competitive. By moving goods from locations where they are sourced to locations where they are demanded, transport provides the essential service of linking suppliers and customers. It is an essential activity in the logistics function, supporting the economic utilities of place and time. Doing this in a green environmentally friendly, clean, resilient, sustainable and inclusive manner is not just a bonus but a necessity that countries, and the world at large can no longer afford to ignore.
      Competing forces in the transport sector dictate the need for a vision that continues to serve the needs of the economy, and of the citizens while meeting future constraints (resource depletion, environmental pollution, and congestion). There is a need to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and to reduce CO2 and other pollutant emissions in order to improve air quality, as well as to reduce the debilitating effects of congestion on the countrys productivity and competitiveness.  
      The Uganda Government commissioned a study to develop a National Transport Policy and Strategy (NTPS). A draft was developed in 2014 but unfortunately to date it was never approved. Owing to a number of reforms that have taken place in the transport sector, it is logical to state that a number of recommendations have been overtaken by events hence the need to update the draft NTPS of 2014. It is also a perfect opportunity to allow for a holistic approach to transport and logistics policy.
      The proposal to develop a Sustainable and Inclusive National Transport and Logistics Policy and Strategy (NTLPS) by updating the National Transport Policy and Strategy of 2014 is an initiative of the Ministry of works and Transport (MoWT). The need arose primarily because the transport policy and strategy of 2014 does not fully address the entire transportation sector spectrum to meet the growing expectation and the needs of the citizens as outlined above.
      .
      B.	OBJECTIVE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
      .
      The overall objective of this assignment is to review and update the current Draft National Transport Policy and Strategy 2014, and include logistics and green transport policy and strategy elements, in order to produce a revised National Transport & Logistics Policy and Strategy. The revised policy and strategy is envisioned to be more holistic, and one that would set the directions as to how transport can contribute to the countrys economic development and competitiveness. This should be developed in support of the achievement of Governments Vision 2040 middle income status goal in an inclusive and sustainable manner.
      .
      C.	SCOPE OF WORK
      .
      The proposed revision will be undertaken through a critical review of previous studies including especially the draft national transport policy and strategy of 2014, and the National Transport Masterplan including the Plan for Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area of 2008. The work will take stock of emerging requirements, and changes that have occurred since, as well as of international best practices for the development of a clean, green, inclusive and sustainable transport and logistics system in the country.
      The proposed work requires the updated analysis of the current Uganda transport and logistics system, projecting into the future (supply and demand), and provide recommendations on ways that it can be made more cost-efficient, more competitive, safer, more environmentally friendly (greener), and better integrated across modes.
      The work will include a quantitative assessment of the impact of transportation and logistics costs (formal and informal) on the cost of exporting and importing in Uganda by use of the statistical analysis of Ugandas recent pattern of domestic and international trade. Once the quantification of the above listed impediments to the economy (transportation services and infrastructure on exporters/importers, and domestic traders and consumers) is made, the Consultant will make the case for the necessary legal, institutional, regulatory, management, financing and investment policy and strategy options.
      Recognizing the vastness of the transportation sector dealing with a number of specialized areas, the task of revising the transport policy would require inputs from a team of competent with wide experience and knowledge in transport policy development in the developed and developing economies. 
      The assignment includes updating the current National Transport Policy through review of related literature and study reports, assessing and identifying gaps, and providing policy recommendations.
      Specifically, the consultancy assignment shall, among others, include the following:
      Task 1: Study and review all the existing key Uganda transport and logistics documentation
      Task 2: Review and update of the institutional structure in the transport and logistics sector
      Task 3: Review and update of the current national legal framework in the transport and logistics sector
      Task 4: Review and update of the status of the transport and logistics sector
      Task 5: Review and update of the policies in the transport and logistics sector
      Task 6: Supply chain analysis of transport and logistics costs for key exports and imports
      Task 7: Regional trade and connectivity 
      Task 8: Prepare a revised National Transport & Logistics Policy and Strategy for Uganda

      Footnote 1:   Transport is the means of conveying or moving people, animals and goods from one place to another. Logistics is the process of planning, implementing and controlling procedures for the efficient, and effective forward and reverse transportation and storage of people, goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of destination. Transport is therefore an important element of the logistics system.
