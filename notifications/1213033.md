      Since 2008, CGAP has been conducting an annual survey of the international funding commitments to microfinance. 
      
      The CGAP survey on cross-border funding for financial inclusion has the following objectives: 
      - Improve coordination among funders: help funders identify who is doing what and where; help identify gaps and areas of concentration
      - Improve accountability: collect and disseminate data on funders portfolio so that their operations become more transparent and funders are held responsible 
      -  Analyze trends in funding for financial inclusion in order to anticipate changes and therefore help funders adapt their strategy
      -  Drive more informed decision making through custom data presentation
      
      CGAP is looking to explore opportunities to complement the survey data with qualitative research on funding trends and new types of funders supporting financial inclusion.
