      IFC is tendering for a firm to evaluate and provide guidance on the potential (or feasibility) for specific gender related housing finance products. It should determine whether there is a business case for the offering of specific gender related housing finance products (e.g. mortgage, home improvement loans, etc.). In order to determine the business opportunity, three topics are of relevance:
      
      1. The Barriers that women currently face in accessing housing finance (and housing):
      	- Obstacles that prevent women from accessing a title on a home (e.g. 
              regulatory constraints) 
      	- Obstacles that prevent women from obtaining a housing loan 
      	- Obstacles that prevent financial institutions from creating and providing appropriate financial mechanisms to increase women's access to housing
      
      2. Market related opportunity for gender-related housing finance products and mechanisms 
      	- Size of the gender gap in housing finance [mortgages secured]
      	- Size of the market for women housing finance borrowers [total revenue]
      	- Segments of women affected most by these barriers, e.g. based on income or 
              employment
      
      3. Recommendations for lenders to target women as borrowers and clients (including potential product solutions)
      	- Changes need to the enabling environment to increase women's access to a
              title (e.g. legal/regulatory framework)
      	- What housing providers can do to target women as borrowers (new products,
              educational/marketing measures)
      	- Incentives that can be created for lenders to develop specific financial 
              products & services for female customers.
      
      4. Additional information about the research work to be undertaken:
      
      Data availability. The research is expected to outline the market opportunity of gender-related housing finance products and financial mechanisms, if possible with quantitative data, but at the minimum with qualitative data, underline the barriers that women currently face in accessing housing finance and finally develop recommendations that housing finance providers can implement in order to specifically target women as clients and borrowers. The recommendations should also outline/sketch potential product solutions that are poised to increase the access of women to housing finance. As data may be difficult to obtain, the consultant needs to make several design choices in scoping the research: (i) how to identify and isolate target segments of female borrowers; (ii) desired precision and granularity of findings; (iii) how to augment existing data: resource-intensity of primary data collection methods. 
      	
      Individual country assessments. The study should include an assessment of 3 countries to showcase the business case. Currently, the following countries have been considered for a more detailed analysis: Colombia, India and Kenya. The firm is requested to review these suggestions of countries critically (in the proposal).
