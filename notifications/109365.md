      Kyrgyz Housing Microfinance Project of International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, aims to promote usage of Solar Water Heaters (SWH) in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan among low-income households and small & micro business.  The objective will be fulfilled through the introduction to local financial institutions of a specialized lending product, enabling the financial institutions (FI) to lend for purchasing and installing SWHs.
      
      Given, that low-income households in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan as well as small/micro business do not have capacity to purchase expensive SWHs, pay for their installation by professional assemblers and ensure proper maintenance the solution suggested to these clients should be comparatively cheap, easy to install and not requiring professional maintenance.    
      
      The Project is procuring services of a company (Consultant further in the text) to perform the following task:
      
      Conduct analyses of existing technological solutions for Solar water heating and suggest the Systems best suited for local low-income households and small & micro businesses. Developed descriptions of SWH systems should be detailed enough for procurement purposes. A SWH system in this context is understood to consist of a set of interrelated pieces of equipment transferring solar energy into heating of water and protected, and protected to the extent necessary under the local conditions, from destruction due to freezing, overheating, electricity blackouts, water supply disturbance, etc. The sets that differ only in the size of key pieces of equipment (tanks, collectors, etc.) are considered to be the same set.  
      
      The following local conditions of Kyrgyz & Tajik Markets should be taken into account:
      -	Climatic conditions including substantial difference between day and night (winter/summer) temperatures.
      -	Frequent and prolonged electricity blackouts.
