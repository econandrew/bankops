      The World Bank is seeking a firm to carry out a geo referenced household survey to contribute to analysis of education and poverty in Haiti.  The survey instrument will collect data on educational attainment and expenditures, and on living standards to compute poverty in Haiti, including among other a household and individual information module, asset ownership and dwelling module, and access to basic services module.  While the sampling strategy has not been decided, spatial considerations will be important. The consulting firm will work closely with the World Bank team to develop the appropriate sampling frame and methods, and will have responsibility to deliver survey implementation, including, iter alia: identifying and training enumerators and supervisors; pilot testing the survey methodology using the agreed upon data collection technology; and ensuring quality control through effective arrangements for field supervision and data collection and household follow-ups.  Deliverables will include clean and formatted survey data, a data codebook in English, and written reports.
