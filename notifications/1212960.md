      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Guatemala is one of the eight CICs. WAVES is assisting the Government of Guatemala (GoG) to consolidate the ongoing institutional efforts to ensure the medium/long term sustainability of NCA, as well as to update the accounts that have already been compiled for the period 2001-2010 using the UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounts (SEEA). Despite significant efforts, there are still major gaps to improve the compilation and institutionalization of NCA, aligning it to policy demands.  WAVES Guatemala will focus on supporting the production of information for prioritized accounts, institutional strengthening of key institutions in particular, aiming to use the accounts and related indicators for policy relevant decision-making.
      Based on the results from a scoping study that informed the policy priorities and entry points, the WAVES Guatemala program will focus in four broad thematic areas: (i) Inclusive green growth and poverty reduction, (ii) Food Security, (iii) Climate change, risk and economic growth, and, (iv) Economic and environmental sustainability. These areas are related to the overarching countrys national development plan, Katun: Our Guatemala 2032.  Work on these policy areas will involve updating the SEEA Central Framework (SEEA-CF) accounts developed for 2001-2010, and include new developments in the area of SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA), SEEA Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Accounts (SEEA-AFF) and Wealth Accounts as per World Bank methodologies.
