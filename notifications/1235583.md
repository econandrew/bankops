      Collaboration with International Academic Partner (IAP) to design and implement a qualitative evaluation of Drought Response Social Safety Net and Nutrition Program in Southern Madagascar
      
      1.	Background
      The Government of Madagascar, with support from the World Bank and UNICEF, has launched the Social Safety Net Drought Response Program in December 2016. This program provides cash transfers, livelihood recovery grants and nutrition services to the poorest households in the most drought affected communities of the regions of Androy and Anosy. The population of the South has suffered through several successive years of poor crop yields starting with a major locust invasion in 2013. Five districts in the two regions of Androy and Anosy are the most affected areas: Tsihombe, Beloha, Ambovombe, Amboasary, and Bekily. As a result of El Niño, rainfall has been about 75 percent lower than the average of the last 20 years, causing harvest losses of up to 95 percent. Over 1 million people are estimated to be food insecure, 35,000 children under 5 suffer from moderate acute malnutrition and another 12,000 from severe acute malnutrition.
      
      The Drought Response Program is targeted at 45,000 extreme poor households (200,000 beneficiaries) during the first 12 months and  will be expanded by an additional 20,000 households (100,000 beneficiaries) during the following 24 months. The of Population, Social Protection, and the Promotion of Women (MPSPPW) is in charge of coordinating the countrys social protection policy including the interventions in the disaster prone South of the country, in collaboration with the National Disaster Management Office which coordinates the humanitarian aid. The implementing agency for the Drought Response Program and other Social Safety Net programs in Madagascar is the Intervention Fund for Development (Fonds d´Intervention pour le Développement or FID).
      
      
      2.	Objectives
      
      The aim of this work is to provide qualitative evidence on the impact of the rollout of the Drought Response Program in the South on households, local economies, and social networks. The World Bank, in collaboration with the Government of Madagascar and UNICEF is looking to work with an International Academic Partner (IAP) that will design and implement the qualitative research of the Drought Response Program in collaboration with a Malagasy University or Research Partner. The design of the action research should be longitudinal following a set of households (exact numbers to be proposed by the IAP) and conduct in-depth interviews with the family members, and then following these same families two more times over the next two years to see how they respond to the cash transfers and nutrition services received by the female head of the household through the Drought Response Program, how they plan and use the cash/livelihood grants, and how they respond to moving from an unconditional cash transfer to a conditional cash transfer linked to primary education.
      
      Based on this research, the Government of Madagascar and the World Bank should have an in depth understanding of how the Drought Response Program impacts households, their young children, gender relations, the local economy, and social networks.
