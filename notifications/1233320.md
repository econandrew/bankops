      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1233320 - Firm: Survey of distribution channels in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Odisha markets

      A.	 ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Lighting Asia/India program has been undertaking various activities since 2012 working to remove market barriers to adoption of quality assured products, through a series of market interventions. The program works with manufacturers and distributors of quality assured solar lighting appliances, to help them develop a robust footprint in underserved markets in India. Over the next 3 years, the program will scale up energy access by deepening its existing level of work and intervention in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, undertaking targeted activities in Rajasthan, and expanding market development activities into low income states that have not yet benefited from these products (Odisha and Assam).  It will also leverage other IFC Lighting programs (Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and PNG) to help Indian companies access international markets.
      
      B.  SCOPE OF WORK:
      Objective and Purpose of the Research: 
      1.	 The Program will engage a firm for the retailer study that will create a database of retailers and distributors to be used for the development of the off-grid lighting market in India. This would cover, but not limited to, information on the supply chain of solar lights (and other products as per list provided by IFC ), estimated market share of quality assured solar lights compared to other solar lighting products, and an overview of the after sales service structure in these categories.  
      
      2.	There will be an additional stream of work, which will involve selling to retailers, resulting in a completely different Scope of Work than the one detailed below. This would mean pitching to the retailers with a product, pricing and sales plan in an effort for them to stock the products of the Lighting Asia/Indias associates. This approach will be discussed with the firm that will get this contract depending on the feasibility, cost and capability of the firm.
