      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: 1213836 - LIGHTING AFRICA  NIGERIA PROGRAM Retail Channel Development
      
      Assignment Countries:
        - Nigeria
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The Lighting Africa Program, a joint IFC and World Bank program, works with manufacturers, distributors, governments, development partners, finance institutions, consumers and other stakeholders to accelerate the development of a sustainable market for off-grid lighting products in Nigeria. 
      Whereas solar is a mature technology, the development of a household segment in Nigeria is virtually non-existent. While the Nigeria off-grid market has attracted a number of new international manufacturers, their major challenge is lack of knowledge and insights of the trade and retail channels, and this has negatively impacted the expansion of solar distribution in Nigeria. 
      The program through its various market development activities seeks to develop an extensive retail channel base covering the key regions hence providing a platform for the growth of a vibrant solar household market in Nigeria.
      The Nigeria Program now seeks to engage a Consulting firm starting April 2016 for a period of 12 months with the opportunity for follow-on work based on performance, to: 
      
      1.	Identify, pre-qualify and recruit potential retail channel members that will stock and retail solar products.
      2.	Assign a team of Retail Market Developers who will: 
      i.	Work very closely with IFC Business Development Consultant to execute point 1 across the targeted regions in Nigeria, and develop a comprehensive database of retailers, sub-distributors and wholesalers and identify new market segments. 
      ii.	Work with the IFC Business Development Consultant to develop and undertake continuous monitoring of the channels and recommend any improvements to enhance their performance
