      REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
      Assessing Sector Capacity for FDI Linkages in Guinea
      
      Country: Guinea
      Name of the project: Guinea Investment Climate  Mining Linkages
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      Extractive industries have notable impacts on development in many resource rich countries through generation of revenues from taxation. They can also add value to the local economy by creating jobs, raising income and promoting local entrepreneurship through local procurement linkages.
      
      In order to ensure that mining projects in Guinea maximize benefits to the domestic economy, the Ministry of Mines, requested the support of the World Bank group Trade & Competitiveness Global Practice for the preparation of a domestic value addition policy (DVA) for the mining sector.  The WBG provided technical assistance for the elaboration of the draft DVA policy which was submitted to the Guinean government before the general elections in November 2015. The team will follow up to complete this important piece of work by supporting the Government in the policys finalization, formal adoption/dissemination and implementation.
      
      To help assess constraints to development of domestic firms as local suppliers to the growing mining industry procurement market in terms of (1) competitiveness and (2) skills development, the World Bank Group (Bank Group) seeks to commission a firm with exceptional depth and breadth of experience across multiple relevant sectors.
      
      During this first phase, the consultant is required to conduct assessment of local Capacity (vs the demand) for FDI Linkages in the mining sector in Guinea and propose recommendations. At the successful completion of this study and upon approval of DVA Policy, the consultant may be considered to support the finalization of a strategic action plan in coordination with the WBG team and local stakeholders.
