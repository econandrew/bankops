      The assignment covers surveying a representative sample of enterprises using a standardized survey instrument via telephone, online and possibly face-to-face interviews with business owners and managers. The survey instruments to be administered will cover firm dynamics; analyzing costs, productivity, sourcing and sales strategies; and determining the barriers to competitiveness, value chain deepening, and job creation at each stage of value chain.
      
      The scope of work and tasks for the study includes the following: 
      
      	The overall mapping of enterprises into value chains and sampling strategy will be designed by the World Bank team. If needed, the consultants will be expected to enhance the mapping or the quality of the sampling frame provided by the World Bank (FINA database). 
      	The selected consultant will conduct the business survey administered to a representative sample of firms. This sample will include firms that are already part of the global supply chain of lead firms and industry leaders, but will also go beyond the existing chain to cover firms that are fully representative of the domestic value chain.
      	The World Bank will provide the quantitative survey questionnaire to be administered. The consultant is expected to contribute to adapting the questionnaire to the local context. 
      	The consultant will conduct a pilot prior to the launching fieldwork and subsequently, adapt the survey instrument for the official fieldwork if necessary.
      	The consultant will be responsible for data entry and cleaning, and timely delivery of data in csv, STATA or other agreed format. 
      	The consultant will be responsible for coordination and management of the project in Croatia, including communication and timely reporting of any relevant issues related to the project to the World Bank team.
      	The consultant will need to work closely with the World Bank team in carrying out mapping, sampling, as well as piloting and implementing the survey.
