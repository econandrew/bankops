      Trade and Competitiveness (T&C) is a joint World Bank and IFC Global Practice, built around a common vision: sustained economic growth, productivity gains, job creation, and rising incomes for developing countries to eradicate poverty and boost shared prosperity. T&Cs mission is to serve as a trusted partner for countries that seek to develop dynamic and resilient economies, expand market opportunities, and enable private initiative. To this end, T&C supports global and country efforts to boost the volume and value of trade, enhance the investment climate, improve competitiveness in sectors, and foster innovation and entrepreneurship.
      
      OHADA (the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa) is an initiative under which 16 African countries established a regional organization to develop a uniform, modern, and sound body of business legislation. The potential impact of reforming OHADA laws on improved investment climate to encourage sustainable growth in these countries is significant.  OHADA laws, which include a set of unified business laws (General Commercial Law, Company Law, Secured Transaction Law, Accounting Law, Insolvency law, etc.) have the potential of catalyzing much improved investment climate in the region.  Specifically, OHADA reforms, over time, could bring the following positive impacts: encourage formalization of economy; improve access to credit; provide greater certainty to execution of contracts; provide better protection for investors; and improve bankruptcy processes. The IC advisory program supported the OHADA Secretariat to introduce amendments to four regional laws (General Commercial Law, Company Law, Secured Transaction Law, and Insolvency law) across 16 member countries in two phases.  
      
      The reforms are expected to bring the positive impacts, among them: 
       Streamlined formalities aim to encourage informal entrepreneurs to join the formal economy. 
       Modernization of secured transactions regimes is expected to make more credit available to the private sector in OHADA countries.
       Computerized collateral registries will increase the reliability of information and reduce uncertainty for lenders, whereby which more credit will be made available to the private sector.   
       Simpler and cheaper procedure to register a business which in turn save compline costs 
       Simpler and cheaper procedure to restructure after bankruptcy.
      
      The OHADA IC program will be evaluated to: 
      
      1. Assess the impact of OHADA reforms supported by program in the member countries as well as in the region; 
      2. Explore and document additional means of assessing the impact generated by OHADA reforms through a deeper search for impact in two (2) selected countries;
      3. Extract lessons particularly related to the program design, operations, delivery, stakeholder engagement and communication. Lessons may reflect comparison of the programs outputs and operational performance between phase 1 & II.   
      4. Assess the sustainability of reforms that have been undertaken in two (2) selected countries, and whether the processes, procedures and institutions set up of the member countries adequate enough to continue operating the reforms;
