      The Government of Georgia has been undertaking Public Investment Management (PIM) reform to enhance strategic allocation of public resources. PIM reform agenda is critical to the imperative of closing the infrastructure gap for accelerating and sustaining economic growth in the context of reduced fiscal space for public investment. Implementation of the new PIM framework -- PIM Guideline (Decree no:191) and Methodological Manual issued April 2016 -- are expected to improve systematic capital investment identification, preparation, appraisal and selection, both for the central ministries and the local governments. As a first step, this framework will be implemented in one central government ministry and in five municipalities as a piloting exercise for the new project proposals above GEL 5 million.
