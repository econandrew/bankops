      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW
      
      Assignment Title: Capacity Building Assessment and Training in Korea on ICT based Land Management Systems 
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      The main objective of this assignment is to enhance human capacity for the design and implementation of modernized ICT-based Land Information and Management Systems in the public and private sectors in selected developing countries (the Clients) by conducting diagnostic analysis on ICT-related capacity, providing training programs and knowledge exchange, and dissemination of lessons.
      
      Korea has been selected as an ideal training site, given its development trajectory and wealth of experience in the land administration sector. Korea was able to establish its own advanced land management capacity in a short period of time owing to the development of a land information system named the Korea Land Information System (KLIS). Today, the KLIS is one of the two central pillars that buttress the e-government system, which is globally recognized as a leader. The Korean experience of linking the KLIS to a world-class e-Government will raise the selected developing countries awareness and knowledge for improving land administration services and creating further meaningful linkages that have wider development impacts.
