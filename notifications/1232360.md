      The World Bank is seeking a consultant to conduct a review of the regulatory and institutional framework and provide recommendations for the enhancement of the SME credit guarantee and other government supported market friendly instruments for improving access to finance for SMEs in the Philippines.
      
      Philippines law sets mandatory targets for lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) with the objective to improve access to finance in these underserved sectors. RA 10000 known as Agri-Agra Law requires that all banks allocate 25% of their total loanable funds for agriculture and fisheries credit, of which at least 10% of the loanable funds should be allocated to agrarian reform beneficiaries. Magna Carta for MSME requires that all banks allocate at least 8% of their loan portfolio to micro and small enterprises and 2% to medium enterprises.
      The analysis of compliance with mandatory lending targets to MSMEs and agriculture indicates that on a system basis banks struggle to expand lending to micro and small enterprises and agrarian reform beneficiaries. Over the past five years lending to micro and small enterprises grew on average at 3% per annum, to medium enterprises at 13%, lending to agriculture actually declined. At the same time total lending portfolio expanded at an average rate of 25% per annum. Despite the targets, growth in priority sectors was significantly lower than the growth of the overall lending portfolio. Philippines experience is not unique and evidence from other countries over the years indicates that lending volume targets are ineffective and may contribute to greater level of risks in the system.
      Credit guarantee schemes are one of the more market friendly types of interventions for SMEs, as they commonly combine a subsidy element with market-based arrangements for credit allocation.  Unlike other types of interventions directed lending arrangements or subsidized lending schemes, they may generate fewer distortions in the credit market and may lead to better credit allocation outcomes. 
      There is a number of institutions providing guarantees in the Philippines. Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation, known as Small Business Corporation or SB Corp) is designated as the primary agency providing assistance to MSMEs including but not limited to finance. PhilEXIM also is a potentially important source of guarantees and credit insurance for exporter SMEs.  Both institutions are small and currently are not able to fully perform the functions envisaged in their mandate due to a range of constraints including regulatory, capital, skills, and ability to attract and retain qualified staff.
