      Assignment Description
      
      The World Bank Group (WBG) Local Investment-friendly Environment (LIFE) Project in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is supporting local authorities in strengthening competitiveness and boosting private sector growth by: (1) Reducing the regulatory burden at the local level; (2) Closing the regulatory implementation gap; (3) Advancing the transparency in regulatory service delivery, and (4) Increasing investments through generating, facilitating and retaining investors in the country. The scope of the LIFE Project includes implementation of the Business Registration One-Stop-Shop Information System in BiH. The System will enable online registration of companies in Republika Srpska (RS), Federation BiH (FBiH) entities (Entities hereinafter), and Brcko Disctrict in Bosnia and Herzegovina with harmonized business registration processes.
      
      The purpose of this assignment is to design and implement the Business Registration 
      Information System (System hereinafter). The System will support: (1) online business registry at Entity level; (2) online reservation of business name; (3) use of electronic signature in business registration and related infrastructure (4) online submission of application for business registration; (5) electronic payment of administrative fees and tracking application status; (6) issuing unique business identifier and business registration process; (7) publication of registered business entity and delivery of registration certificate to applicant; (8) integration to support the post-registration processes including (but not necessarily mean that all of these will be required) opening bank account, VAT registration, fiscalization of cash register and registering employees.  
      
      The assignment will be phased, it will start with design of the System, followed by the the deployment phases in Entities (Republika Srpska and Federation BiH) and Br?ko District. The deployment phases will include delivery of the hardware, migration of data and documents from already established business registration information source hosted in the cloud and trainings for the end-users and administrators of the System. These phases are not inter-dependent, and they can be treated as separate installations for each of the entities, with separate timeline, resources, and requirements.  The post-implementation maintenance and support phase will last for one year following the acceptance of the System.  
      
      The System shall follow modular design applying Service Level Architecture (SOA), with possibility to be tailored to different level of readiness of Entities and Br?ko District (meaning it can mean two designs  a new system design for Federation BiH and Br?ko, while upgrading existing system in Republika Srpska; for example, Republika Srpska already established support for processing business registration cases, and requires modules to enable online applications and issuing registration certificates in electronic form). Consultants shall support having two separate work streams (one for Republika Srpska and second for Federation BiH and Br?ko District) in meeting project objectives for this assignment.  The System will be integrated into the existing e-Government eco-systems in Entities and Br?ko District, including integration with the Interoperability Information System currently being implemented, towards the integrated service delivery approach at the level of Entities and Br?ko District in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
      
      Objectives
      
      The following goals of establishing the Business Registration One-Stop-Shop (OSS) in BiH are identified: (1) reduce the time for business registration to within three days in both entities for all types of limited liability companies; (2) reduce number of steps to register a company by 50% in Federation BiH; (3) reduce costs of business registration by 15% in both entities; (4) increase the number of newly registered businesses in BiH by15% in 1.5 years after the implementation; (5) improve Doing Business ranking for starting a business in BiH; and 6) increase transparency of business registration in both entities.
