   ADVERTISEMENT_TEXT: 'IFC is interested in developing mechanisms to develop solar PV combined with (electrochemical) storage (Scaling Solar with Storage). Storage would be used to time shift production to evening peak hours. Projects would be tendered that would require developers to finance, build and operate a hybrid solar PV and battery storage power plant under a 25year power purchase agreement. The plants would be project financed. IFC is now seeking to update and amend its template documents include RFQ technical criteria, RFP technical requirements and PPA technical requirements developed under the "scaling Solar" approach.'
