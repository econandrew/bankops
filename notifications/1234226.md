      1. BACKGROUND
      
      A. Finance & Markets Global Practice
      
      The World Bank Group Finance & Markets Global Practice (F&M GP) delivers tailored development solutions to countries and the global community working with our public and private sector clients. Our commitment is to support the twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.

      B. Credit infrastructure Global Solutions Group
      
      The Credit Infrastructure Global Solutions Group (GSG) assists client governments and the global community in improving access to credit.  We do this primarily through the establishment and strengthening of credit reporting, secured transactions and insolvency & debtor/creditor rights (ICR) systems.  We have a special focus where the infrastructure for credit remains a huge obstacle for SMEs.  The GSG provides advice to clients  helping them reform legal and regulatory frameworks, creating and/or strengthening related institutions, including electronic registries, raising awareness and building capacity as well as monitoring impact.  In addition, the GSG leads the setting of international standards in certain areas of credit infrastructure and promotes global expertise.  In particular, this GSG carries out the World Bank Group's mandate as the global standard-setter for ICR, as designated by the Financial Stability Board.
      
      2. THE FINANCIAL LITERACY AND PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN 
      
      As part of its efforts to assist in the strengthening of the credit infrastructure in Ghana, IFC is seeking a reputable and experienced communications agency to design and execute a Financial Literacy and Public Awareness Campaign for a period of one year to promote the use and benefits of the credit information and collateral registry systems established in Ghana in collaboration with a working group consisting of relevant stakeholders. 
      
      The objective of the Financial Literacy and Public Awareness Campaign is to:  i)Promote and raise awareness on the use and benefits of using the Collateral Registry; ii) Raise awareness on the tools available for access to credit, particularly credit bureaus and iii) Promote responsible lending and borrowing while addressing some of the most common issues that consumers and SMEs have regarding their personal and business finances.
      
      The communications agency will be expected to produce a communications strategy relying on various forms of media outreach, potentially including advertising and or radio/television infomercials. The campaign is encouraged to specifically target news coverage for impact and credibility, and should include a comprehensive social media strategy. The design of the communications strategy will be supervised by an IFC communications officer and developed in close collaboration with the IFC regional communications team and the Working group.
