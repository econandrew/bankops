      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      MTF survey in Nepal Expression of Interest 
      The World Bank-ESMAP team is launching the first Global Energy Access Household, Community/Facility, Enterprise, and Mini-grid operator Surveys in access deficit countries to set a baseline to track progress towards Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) goal and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 7 on access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy by 2030. 
      Access to electricity in Nepal has increased from 70% to 76% of the population from 1990 to 2012 (GTF 2015). However, most of this access is concentrated in the urban areas (97%) with rural areas lagging behind (76%). Supply shortages have limited widespread electricity availability and people connected to the grid power often suffer from reliability and quality of supply.  Additionally, only 20% of the population has access to non-solid fuels for cooking (WHO estimate).  Pollution from solid fuel stoves causes eye problems and respiratory diseases in addition to environmental harm. This survey will collect data to determine how to close the gap in access to electricity and increase use of improved cooking solutions and non-solid fuels so Nepal can track the progress towards the SDG energy objectives.  
      A reputed firm with extensive experience in household surveys and, preferably, expertise on energy sector including on-grid and off-grid solutions including mini-grid is sought to conduct the household, community/facility, enterprise, and mini-grid operator survey to establish the baseline on energy access in the Nepal using the multi-tier framework approach to track progress towards SDG7 and SE4ALL goal. The survey will be nationally representative and administered to both urban and rural localities. The firm will work with the World Bank-ESMAP to pre-test, finalize and implement the survey. Data collection should be carefully monitored to ensure high quality information. After completing the fieldwork, the firm will deliver the final dataset and summary report to the World Bank-ESMAP.  Additional details on the scope of work will be available in the Terms of Reference (TOR).
