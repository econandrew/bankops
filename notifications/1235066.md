      The World Bank Group (WBG) is seeking to pre-qualify Firms to provide software development services in Sub-Saharan Africa under an Indefinite Delivery Agreement. 
      
      The World Bank Group promotes sustainable private sector investment in developing countries as a means to reduce poverty and improve peoples lives. In addition to its investment and lending activities, the WBG executes a major donor-funded program of private sector technical assistance and advisory services. 
      
      The Trade and Competitiveness (T&C) Global Practice provides a range of lending and advisory services to support client governments in improving the business environment for domestic and foreign investors. Support is provided to implement reforms that reduce unnecessary costs and risks faced by firms, strengthen fair competition, and promote investment.  Investment Climate (IC) reform work focuses on several areas including  business registration, business licensing and inspections, construction permitting, investment policy and promotion, transparency in regulatory rulemaking and provision of business-to-government feedback on the quality of public service delivery. Assistance is also available for a range of short-term interventions designed to address specific issues highlighted in the Doing Business indicators. 
      
      In Sub-Saharan Africa, the T&C Global Practice manages technical assistance programs in over 30 countries through a network of hub offices in Dakar, Nairobi and Johannesburg as well as country program coordinators in the local WBG offices.  These are supported by the Investment Climate unit in Washington, DC, which provides technical expertise in a number of areas, including information technology. 
      
       The types of services will include the following:
      a)	New development and pilot implementation of software application(s) to support investment climate reform and improved government-to-business service delivery;
      b)	Application maintenance, support and upgrades;
      c)	Localization and deployment of existing applications in new clients; 
      d)	Testing of completed software applications;
      
      More details on the assignment are contained in the Request for Expression document attached. 
      
       This Request for Expressions of Interest (REI) is intended will be used to select qualified Firms to participate in a later solicitation for the above-mentioned services that will be issued by the WBG.  
      
      Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other representations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this REI are not desired.  Firms are requested to limit their Expressions of Interest to twenty (20) pages, not including project references.
      
      Only qualified Firms will receive the solicitation. The WBG is not obligated to award a contract on the basis of the responses to this REI document or to otherwise compensate Firms for providing the information requested. The WBG reserves the right to defer or cancel any solicitation without penalty.
       
      All Firms determined to be qualified will be invited to submit a response to the solicitation for the services. 
         
      The conditions of contract to be used for this IDA shall be the World Banks standard Services Contract as published by the World Bank Group.
