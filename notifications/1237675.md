      The World Bank Group (WBG) is seeking an expression of interest from highly qualified and experienced survey firms with strong experience in conducting firm/entrepreneurship related face-to-face survey work in Jordan. The firm should be specializing in surveying firms, single entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs (many of whom could be women, youth, and/or informal) and should demonstrate strong ability of conducting a large scale baseline and endline survey of approximately 2000 (or more) Jordanian and Syrian businesses, entrepreneurs, and potential entrepreneurs currently located in Jordan. This would be a phased assignment over a period of 2 or more years. The first phase will involve a pilot exercise that will require a survey of approximately 150-200 businesses immediately upon the award of the contract (this fieldwork and data entry needs to be completed within a time span of 2-3 weeks immediately upon signing of the contract) followed by a more detailed listing exercise and the baseline survey of firms (to cover 2000 businesses across different parts of Jordan in different phases over a period of next 3-4 months, with each phase containing around 300-500 businesses). The firm should be also able to develop a sound and thorough listing of businesses to design the sample frame leveraging traditional means with social media (particularly to reach out to the population of businesses or entrepreneurs who cannot be found in the conventional registration databases. The assignment is expected to start by no later than end of March, 2017. 
      Well-qualified and competent firms should submit their EoI with precise demonstration (and not generic) of proven qualification and track record of the above skills/requirements.
