      These Terms of Reference are for a Consulting firm to work with the World Bank (WB) on an impact evaluation of the Engaging Men through Accountable Practice (EMAP) project in North and South Kivu. This TOR is for the data collection activities during the first 12 months of the impact evaluation. Based on the Consulting firms phase-1 performance, this contract may be extended to include work on phase-2 activities (e.g. endline survey). 
      
      Since December 2014, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is implementing a project supported by the World Bank (SPF Grant No. TF018380) that aims to improve the provision of services that promote treatment and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in North and South Kivu in the DRC. 
      
      In the framework of this project, the IRC is implementing the Engaging Men through Accountable Practice (EMAP) approach designed to target both men and women and empower men as agents of change. Given the need to generate evidence of scalable and cost-effective strategies to engage men in the fight against SGBV and change behaviors, the implementation of EMAP provides an excellent opportunity to conduct a rigorous impact evaluation. 
      
      The Consulting firm will design and implement the baseline quantitative data collection among 3000 respondents and the qualitative data collection according to the sampling plan provided by the Research Team. The responsibilities of the Consulting firm, include but are not limited to the following tasks:
      
      1.	Communication and coordination with the Research Team
      1.1.	Continuous engagement with the Research Team during critical activity periods, including the listing, baseline, and intervention launch, to ensure key decisions are in-line with the study design and that progress occurs on a reasonable timeline.
      1.2.	The consulting firm will proactively and regularly communicate any and all concerns, questions, problems and decisions to the Research Team. 
      1.3.	All changes to the data collection operation plan that may impact the design of the study will be submitted to the Research Teams for discussion and decision. 
      
      2.	Questionnaire development and finalization 
      2.1.	Work with the Research Team to develop, pilot and finalize the baseline survey questionnaire.
      2.2.	Develop questionnaires and qualitative interview guides and other tools, including translation in the relevant local languages of survey tools and transcriptions of qualitative interviews. 
      2.3.	Develop a questionnaire piloting plan to be approved by the Research Team.

      3.5.	Contingency plan: to ensure continuity in the survey administration in case of failure of electronic data collection, the consulting firm will provide the enumerators with a sufficient number of paper questionnaires in the appropriate local language. All paper-based data will be double-entered and merged with electronically collected data. An indicator variable will be introduced in the dataset. 
      
      4.	Staffing and training

      4.2.	The enumerators will receive a 2-3 week intensive training in collaboration with the Research Team.
      4.3.	The training will emphasize guidelines for conducting interviews among potential survivors of SGBV, ensuring that all enumerators, supervisors and data managers are adequately trained to respect the rights of study subjects, including confidentiality and consent, and to avoid any risk of re-traumatization of survivors. All data collection staff will be trained to ensure that any survivors reporting an incident are immediately referred to receive appropriate support and services.
      4.4.	The Research Team will develop training protocols and material for data collection and will lead the training. The Consulting firm will provide in-country support to the Research Team, including HR and logistical arrangements (venue, materials, catering).

      5.4.	Ensure that interviews are conducted with the target study participants by verifying respondents identity prior to surveying them.
      5.5.	Ensure that the completed surveys and entered data include adequately and sufficient information to identify respondents to be re-interviewed at endline in order to minimize respondent attrition. 
      5.6.	Ensure that ethical guidelines for research with human subjects are followed, including developing and following informed consent procedures for each survey respondent, conducting individual interviews that are private, and protecting the privacy of respondents data.  
      5.7.	Ensure that a referral system is in place for respondents reporting an incident and that survivors are immediately referred by the data collection staff to receive appropriate support and services.
