      COAST is intended as a platform for innovative financing to address a combined set of challenges including food and livelihood security and climate change. The aim is to incentivize sustainable and resilient fisheries management through a sovereign risk insurance product. The COAST partnership wish to develop a score card assessment tool to reflect the degree of a country's progress against the CCCFP and the need for financial and technical support to advance its implementation.

This would allow CCRIF to use the score to discount premium payment (and potentially offer payout bonuses) under COAST insurance.
