      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      Lighting Africa is a joint World Bank/IFC program aimed at helping people in Sub-Saharan Africa gain access to nonfossil fuel-based, low-cost, high-quality, safe, and reliable lighting products. The program addresses the lighting needs of rural, urban, and sub-urban consumers without electricity accesspredominantly low-income households and businesses. 
      Following the success of the Lighting Kenya pilot program, the Lighting Kenya II program is currently implementing its activities through leading MFIs and with the support of quality-verified product manufacturers across rural Kenya to support last mile distribution of off-grid lighting solutions. To support this, the Program is procuring a firm to strengthen the role that women play in the supply chain for off-grid lighting products in rural Kenya through a 'light-touch' entrepreneurship development and mentorship support package.
      Specifically, this would include: identification and recruitment of women groups and entrepreneurs with high potential to participate in the off-grid lighting supply chain; training of for these groups of women with the aim of developing a shortlist of those who will receive business mentorship; and ultimately leading to about 200 women-owned off-grid lighting businesses providing either sales and after-sales support, or both depending on the capacity of the enterprise. The assignment is expected to run over a 9 month period, starting from April - December 2016, with the possibility of extension following a review of the initial period.
