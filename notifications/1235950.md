      The Independent Evaluation Office is requesting Expressions 
      of Interest from individual consultants for the Biodiversity Focal Area Study with a specific focus to review the 'mainstreaming' of GEF's Biodiversity activities.
      
      Recently, the GEF IEO undertook a Value for Money (VFM) 
      analysis to assess the efficiency of GEF investments and technical support to 
      biodiversity projects. Drawing on previous studies and evaluations, 
      this current evaluation aims to assess three evolving dimensions of the GEFs
      Biodiversity Strategy, that are yet to be independently evaluated. 
      These three areas are: 
       Biodiversity mainstreaming, including Payment for Ecosystem Services(PES) 
       Nagoya Protocol and, 
       Combatting Illegal Wildlife Trade 
      
      The studies on Nagoya Protocol and, Combatting Illegal Wildlife 
      Trade and PES will be commissioned through separate consultancies.
      
      The primary objective of this consultancy is to undertake an in-depth study to evaluate the conditions under which biodiversity mainstreaming is being operationalized in GEF investments. Specifically, the study will assess: 
      The conditions under which biodiversity mainstreaming is being operationalized 
      O At the strategic policy level 
      O Project design and implementation 
      The effectiveness of the Monitoring & Evaluation systems for biodiversity 
      mainstreaming 
      o What is the results framework? 
      O Are the indicators appropriate for assessing the outcomes of mainstreaming 
      efforts? 
       Analysis of the Biodiversity Mainstreaming Portfolio 
       Key lessons from the past and ongoing mainstreaming efforts
