      ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW

      Assignment Countries:
        - United States
      
      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      A.	Project Background and Objectives
      On August 4th, 2016, following four years of intensive review and consultation, the World Banks Board of Executive Directors agreed to replace the World Banks Environmental and Social Safeguard policies with a new Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) for Investment Project Financing (IPF) (www.worldbank.org).  The ESF is currently scheduled to become effective for new Bank projects in early 2018.  The goal of the ESF is to better support the Bank in achieving its twin goals to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity in a sustainable manner in all Partner countries.  To that end, the Bank has sought to modernize its approach to environmental and social risk management by developing a modern, fit-for-purpose framework to safeguard people and the environment, that better meets the varied needs of Borrowers facing new environmental and social challenges.    
      
      The ESF comprises a Vision, a Policy and a set of ten (10) Environmental and Social Standards (ESS).  The Policy governs the Banks approach to the Framework, and the Standards are the environmental and social standards that Borrowers have to meet for their project to receive financing by the World Bank.  The ESF is less proscriptive in its approach than the former safeguard policies, requiring Bank staff to exercise more judgment in the management of environmental and social risk.  It adopts an adaptive management approach over the project cycle that will change the way teams think about designing and delivering projects.  It also enhances the scope of social issues covered, boosts protection for the environment and the poorest and most vulnerable people, and addresses new issues such as labor and community health that will require both Bank and Borrowers to learn new technical skills.  For more information on the ESF please consult the following link: 
      
      https://consultations.worldbank.org/consultation/review-and-update-world-bank-safeguard-policies
      
      The Bank has developed a plan to implement the ESF in four phases over five years.  Implementation will require capacity strengthening of both Borrowers and Bank staff, to upgrade existing skills, learn new skills, and adapt behaviors to a new way of working.  It will also require renewed management systems, procedures and processes, development of knowledge resources and guidance materials for Borrowers and Bank staff, and a range of additional activities to support both the Bank and the Borrowers to transition to the new Framework.     
      
      The World Bank Group is now seeking experienced consulting firms to provide services in support of the implementation of the Framework.
      
      The World Bank seeks to pre-qualify consulting firms specialized in the delivery of professional environmental, social and health and safety consulting services for support across a range of tasks and topic areas, in support of ESF implementation.   Firms should indicate their wish to bid on some or all of the following work and/or technical areas.  The Bank reserves the right to add additional assignments at a later date.
