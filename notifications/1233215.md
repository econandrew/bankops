      Assignment Countries:

      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      The overall objective of this assignment is to create a comprehensive inventory of all business formalities in Jordan. Formalities can include licenses, permits, pre-registration approvals, and other types of formalities that businesses must obtain before operating, including unwritten requirements.   The inventory is to include information about the legal basis, procedures, revenues, fees and costs, and a rough assessment of the efficiency and relevance of the individual formality. This will constitute an important source of information for the reform of the business licensing regime in Jordan.
      
      The consultant will depend on the assessments carried by other projects on licensing, namely: the Jordan Competitiveness and Investment Project, and the National Inspection Reform in Jordan.
