      The World Bank's early Learning Partnership (ELP) innovation Fund is exploring how to increase access to quality early leaning at scale, in partnership with the non-state sector. 
      
      In India, the private sector plays a significant role in education, particularly for early learning. A recent study of 4,300 parents across 8 cities in India suggested that up to 90% of children attending preschool enrolled in private schools. These are typically low-cost private schools, often linked to a primary school. The poor quality of many ECE services was confirmed when providers were observed directly. The pedagogy used was centered on rote memorization. Students were passive listeners in a lecture-based model. Writing was taught at an early age when motor skills are not yet sufficiently refined (particularly between the ages of 2-4). Negative reinforcement through regular rebukes and punishment was the norm. Teaching lacked local context and relevance (e.g., S for Snowman) and the environment was usually cramped, with a high student: teacher ratio. Low-cost private school owners also seem predominantly driven by enrollment numbers and profit, rather than the quality of the education. This, combined with limited parental awareness of what good ECE practice should look like, and a lack of effective accountability mechanisms, mean that low-cost private school owners are not incentivized to invest in improving the quality of the provision and education outcomes.
      
      The ELP Innovation Fund is inviting Expressions of Interest from organizations who can offer intervention models that improve the quality of ECE provided by affordable private Schools and will drive learning as to the potential role of APS in delivering quality ECE at scale.
