      ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
      
      BACKGROUND
      
      The World Bank with financial support from the Government of the United Kingdom has launched a trust fund for Strategic Partnership for Egypts Inclusive Growth (SPEIG) UK Trust Fund. Among the activities proposed to be supported by SPEIG is the design and implementation support for a comprehensive modernization program of the petroleum and gas sector in Egypt (Modernization program). Phase 1 of the Modernization Program has been completed, where a comprehensive design of key priorities for Modernization Program have been finalized - (1) Enhancing investment attraction through streamlining concession agreements;(2) Sector restructuring into separate policy, regulatory and operational entities;(3) Improving its human resource practices;(4) Optimizing downstream performance;(5)redesigning its upstream contractual frameworks, and enhance operational efficiency across value chain of oil and gas network; and(6)Promoting Egypt as a regional gas hub. These prioritized activities are intended to attain the three objectives of reducing fiscal deficit, attract private sector capital especially foreign investments in the petroleum and gas sector in Egypt, and demonstrate a role model for improving public sector governance within Egypt. In addition, a detailed institutional structure with a fully staffed (Modernization Realization Office "RO") as the core nucleus of the program has been set up, along with pre-identified activities as quick wins over 3-9 months backed by a strategic communications program.
      
      OBJECTIVE
      This 12-month assignment will assist the Ministry of Petroleum (MoP) in Egypt with the overall program management of the comprehensive 'Modernization Program' of the country's petroleum and gas sector. This will include support to the monitoring of quick wins, to the implementation of the strategic communication program, and to the restructuring of existing institutions into separate entities or organizations responsible for policy, regulatory and operational functions. 
      
      The consultant will work closely with the Egyptian MoP and the World Bank. The consultant will be hired by the World Bank. 
      
      SCOPE
