STPs Tourism and Hospitality Directorate (DGTH), in its role as the lead agency for the development and promotion of tourism to the country, is now embarking upon a new strategic planning process for the sector.  As tourism arrivals and interest from investors grow, DGTH requires a sound strategy to help guide its decisions and activities over the next eight years.  
      While the DGTH will be actively involved in the planning process, it has identified the need for two international tourism consultants to support the process.  These include: a) Tourism Strategy Development Specialist (and international team leader), and b) Tourism Marketing Specialist.
